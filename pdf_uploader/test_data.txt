AB  - The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine 
      kinases plays an important role in the biology of many cancers. In breast and 
      gastrointestinal cancer, and at lower rates also in additional tumor types, HER2 
      and its homo- or heterodimerization with HER1 or HER3 are essential for cancer 
      cell growth and survival. Breast cancer patients overexpressing HER2 have a more 
      aggressive course of their disease. The poor prognosis associated with HER2 
      overexpression can be substantially improved by adding HER2-targeted therapy to 
      standard of care using the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Lapatinib, an oral 
      dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocks HER1 and HER2 tyrosine kinase activity by 
      binding to the ATP-binding site of the receptor's intracellular domain, resulting 
      in inhibition of tumor cell growth. Lapatinib is generally well tolerated with 
      diarrhea being the most common adverse effect. However, although being mainly of 
      mild to moderate severity, interruption or discontinuation of treatment has been 
      reported in a substantial proportion of patients in clinical trials. In 2007, 
      lapatinib has been approved in combination with capecitabine in patients with 
      advanced HER2-positive breast cancer upon progressive disease following standard 
      therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. In 2013, the approval was 
      extended to a chemotherapy-free combination with trastuzumab for patients with 
      metastatic HER2-positive, hormone receptor-negative breast cancer progressing on 
      prior trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Since 2010, lapatinib is approved in 
      combination with letrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced 
      HER2- and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In contrast, in first-line 
      cytotoxic-based therapy of both early and advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, 
      data from clinical trials did not provide evidence of additional benefit of 
      lapatinib compared to trastuzumab. Moreover, over the past few years, novel 
      HER2-targeted drugs, either alone or as a combined anti-HER2 approach, have been 
      extensively evaluated, demonstrating a more favorable outcome. Also, neither in 
      first- nor second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, lapatinib has been 
      proven to be superior compared to trastuzumab as hitherto standard of care HER2 
      blockade. Therefore, lapatinib has become somewhat less important in patients 
      with HER2-positive breast cancer during the past 10 years since its first 
      introduction. Nevertheless, consideration of treatment with lapatinib appears to 
      be reasonable in selected patients not only in the approved applications but also 
      beyond, and further indications such as HER2-positive refractory metastatic 
      colorectal cancer may arise in future. Also, lapatinib may have distinct 
      advantages over antibodies in targeting truncated HER2 and crossing the 
      blood-brain barrier. Finally, the favorable cardiac toxicity profile of lapatinib 
      makes it an attractive alternative to trastuzumab-based regimens in patients at 
      risk for cardiac events.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is a common, dose-dependent adverse effect of 
      several antineoplastics. It can lead to detrimental dose reductions and 
      discontinuation of treatment, and severely affects the quality of life of cancer 
      survivors. Clinically, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy presents as 
      deficits in sensory, motor, and autonomic function which develop in a glove and 
      stocking distribution due to preferential effects on longer axons. The 
      pathophysiological processes are multi-factorial and involve oxidative stress, 
      apoptotic mechanisms, altered calcium homeostasis, axon degeneration and membrane 
      remodeling as well as immune processes and neuroinflammation. This review 
      focusses on the commonly used antineoplastic substances oxaliplatin, cisplatin, 
      vincristine, docetaxel, and paclitaxel which interfere with the cancer cell 
      cycle-leading to cell death and tumor degradation-and cause severe acute and 
      chronic peripheral neuropathies. We discuss drug mechanism of action and 
      pharmacokinetic disposition relevant to the development of peripheral neuropathy, 
      the epidemiology and clinical presentation of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, 
      emerging insight into genetic susceptibilities as well as current understanding 
      of the pathophysiology and treatment approaches.

AB  - CONTEXT: Multiple treatments for metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
      (mHSPC) are available, but their effects on health-related quality of life 
      (HRQoL) and benefit-harm balance remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical 
      effectiveness regarding survival and HRQoL, safety, and benefit-harm balance of 
      mHSPC treatments. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov until March 1, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      comparing docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, and 
      radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) mutually or with 
      ADT alone were eligible. Three reviewers independently performed screening, data 
      extraction, and risk of bias assessment in duplicate. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Across 
      ten RCTs, we found relevant survival benefits for ADT + docetaxel (high certainty 
      according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and 
      Evaluation [GRADE]), ADT + abiraterone (moderate certainty), ADT + enzalutamide 
      (low certainty), ADT + apalutamide (high certainty), and 
      ADT + docetaxel + darolutamide (high certainty) compared with ADT alone. 
      ADT + radiotherapy appeared effective only in low-volume de novo mHSPC. We found 
      a short-term HRQoL decrease lasting 3-6 mo for ADT + docetaxel (moderate 
      certainty) and a potential HRQoL benefit for ADT + abiraterone up to 24 mo of 
      follow-up (moderate certainty) compared with ADT alone. There was no difference 
      in HRQoL for ADT + enzalutamide, ADT + apalutamide, or ADT + radiotherapy over 
      ADT alone (low-high certainty). Grade 3-5 adverse effect rates were increased 
      with all systemic combination treatments. A benefit-harm assessment showed high 
      probabilities (>60%) for a net clinical benefit with ADT + abiraterone, 
      ADT + enzalutamide, and ADT + apalutamide, while ADT + docetaxel and 
      ADT + docetaxel + darolutamide appeared unlikely (<40%) to be beneficial. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial survival benefits, no systemic combination 
      treatment showed a clear HRQoL improvement compared with ADT alone. We found 
      evidence for a short-term HRQoL decline with ADT + docetaxel and a higher net 
      clinical benefit with ADT + abiraterone, ADT + apalutamide and 
      ADT + enzalutamide. While individualized decision-making remains important and 
      economic factors need to be considered, the evidence may support a general 
      preference for the combination of ADT with androgen receptor axis-targeted 
      therapies over docetaxel-containing strategies. PATIENT SUMMARY: We assessed 
      different combination treatments for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
      cancer. While survival was better with all systemic combination treatments, there 
      was no clear improvement in health-related quality of life compared with androgen 
      deprivation therapy alone. Novel hormonal combination treatments had a more 
      favorable benefit-harm balance than combination treatments that include 
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Related Pulmonary Toxicity: Focus on Nivolumab.
PG  - 600-605
LID - 10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001166 [doi]
AB  - The development of checkpoint inhibitors has changed the treatment paradigm for 
      cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cemiplimab target 
      programmed death-1 (PD-1), whereas durvalumab, avelumab, and atezolizumab target 
      PD-ligand 1. Ipilimumab targets cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4. Used 
      as monotherapy or in combination, these inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy 
      in melanoma, lung cancer, urothelial cancer, and many other solid tumors, and 
      indications are continuing to evolve. Checkpoint inhibitors are well tolerated 
      when compared with traditional chemotherapy. The major adverse effect profiles 
      are idiosyncratic immune-mediated toxicities resulting from the abnormal 
      activation of autoreactive T cells, which can lead to inflammation in any organ 
      system. The most commonly affected organs are bowel, lung, skin, and endocrine. 
      Pulmonary toxicity is important to recognize, and it can be more challenging to 
      diagnose in lung cancer patients, given the nature of the disease course and 
      treatment. This review article focuses on all of the pulmonary adverse effects of 
      a single PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab) that have been described in the literature. 
      These complications include dyspnea, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, pulmonary 
      sarcoidosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, 
      organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, adult respiratory distress 
      syndrome, and lung cavitation. Clinicians must be aware of these toxicities and 
      mindful when prescribing these medications in patients with known lung 
      dysfunction due to chronic lung diseases or lung cancer.

TI  - Capecitabine: a review.
PG  - 23-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluorouracil (FU) is an antimetabolite with activity against numerous 
      types of neoplasms, including those of the breast, esophagus, larynx, and 
      gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Systemic toxicity, including 
      neutropenia, stomatitis, and diarrhea, often occur due to cytotoxic 
      nonselectivity. Capecitabine was developed as a prodrug of FU, with the goal of 
      improving tolerability and intratumor drug concentrations through tumor-specific 
      conversion to the active drug. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to 
      review the available information on capecitabine with respect to clinical 
      pharmacology, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      properties, clinical efficacy for breast and colorectal cancer adverse-effect 
      profile, documented drug interactions, dosage and administration, and future 
      directions of ongoing research. METHODS: Relevant English-language literature was 
      identified through searches of PubMed (1966 to August 2004), International 
      Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1977 to August 2004), and the Proceedings of the 
      American Society of Clinical Oncology (January 1995 to August 2004). Search terms 
      included capecitabine, Xeloda, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. The 
      references of the identified articles were reviewed for additional sources. In 
      addition, product information was obtained from Roche Pharmaceuticals. Studies 
      from the identified literature that addressed this article's objectives were 
      selected for review, with preference given to Phase II/III trials. RESULTS: 
      Capecitabine is an oral prodrug that is converted to its only active metabolite, 
      FU, by thymidine phosphorylase. Higher levels of this enzyme are found in several 
      tumors and the liver, compared with normal healthy tissue. In adults, 
      capecitabine has a bioavailability of approximately 100% with a Cmax of 3.9 mg/L, 
      Tmax of 1.5 to 2 hr, and AUC of 5.96 mg.h/L. The predominant route of elimination 
      is renal, and dosage reduction of 75% is recommended in patients with creatinine 
      clearance (CrCl) of 30 to 50 mL/min. The drug is contraindicated if CrCl is < 30 
      mL/min. Capecitabine has shown varying degrees of efficacy with acceptable 
      tolerability in numerous cancers including prostate, renal cell, ovarian, and 
      pancreatic, with the largest amount of evidence in metastatic breast and 
      colorectal cancer. Single-agent capecitabine was compared with IV FU/leucovorin 
      (LV) using the bolus Mayo Clinic regimen in 2 Phase III trials as first-line 
      treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Overall response rate 
      (RR) favored the capecitabine arm (26% vs 17%, P < 0.001); however, this did not 
      translate into a difference in time to progression (TTP) (4.6 months vs 4.7 
      months) or overall survival (OS) (12.9 months vs 12.8 months). In Phase II 
      noncomparative trials, combinations of capecitabine with oxaliplatin or 
      irinotecan have produced results similar to regimens combining FU/LV with the 
      same agents in patients with colorectal cancer. In metastatic breast cancer 
      patients who had received prior treatment with an anthracycline-based regimen, a 
      Phase III trial comparing the combination of capecitabine with docetaxel versus 
      docetaxel alone demonstrated superior objective tumor RR (42% vs 30%, P = 0.006), 
      median TTP (6.1 months vs 4.2 months, P < 0.001), and median OS (14.5 months vs 
      11.5 months, P = 0.013) with the combination treatment. Noncomparative Phase II 
      studies have also supported efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
      pretreated with both anthracyclines and taxanes, yielding an overall RR of 15% to 
      29% and median OS of 9.4 to 15.2 months. The most common dose-limiting adverse 
      effects associated with capecitabine monotherapy are hyperbilirubinemia, 
      diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. Myelosuppression, fatigue and weakness, 
      abdominal pain, and nausea have also been reported. Compared with bolus FU/LV, 
      capecitabine was associated with more hand-foot syndrome but less stomatitis, 
      alopecia, neutropenia requiring medical management, diarrhea, and nausea. 
      Capecitabine has been reported to increase serum phenytoin levels and the 
      international normalized ratio in patients receiving concomitant phenytoin and 
      warfarin, respectively. The dose of capecitabine approved by the US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) for both metastatic colorectal and breast cancer is 1250 
      Mg/M2 given orally twice per day, usually separated by 12 hours for the first 2 
      weeks of every 3-week cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine is currently approved by 
      the FDA for use as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal 
      cancer when single-agent fluoropyrimidine therapy is preferred. The drug is also 
      approved for use as (1) a single agent in metastatic breast cancer patients who 
      are resistant to both anthracycline- and paclitaxel-based regimens or in whom 
      further anthracycline treatment is contra indicated and (2) in combination with 
      docetaxel after failure of prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Single-agent 
      and combination regimens have also shown benefits in patients with prostate, 
      pancreatic, renal cell, and ovarian cancers. Improved tolerability and comparable 
      efficacy compared with IV FU/LV in addition to oral administration make 
      capecitabine an attractive option for the treatment of several types of cancers 
      as well as the focus of future trials.

TI  - Adverse Renal Effects of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Narrative Review.
PG  - 160-169
LID - 10.1159/000455014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer immunotherapy, such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated 
      protein 4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1), has revolutionized the 
      treatment of malignancies by engaging the patient's own immune system against the 
      tumor rather than targeting the cancer directly. These therapies have 
      demonstrated a significant benefit in the treatment of melanomas and other 
      cancers. SUMMARY: In order to provide an extensive overview of the renal 
      toxicities induced by these agents, a Medline search was conducted of published 
      literature related to ipilimumab-, pembrolizumab-, and nivolumab-induced kidney 
      toxicity. In addition, primary data from the initial clinical trials of these 
      agents and the FDA adverse reporting system database were also reviewed to 
      determine renal adverse events. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), 
      podocytopathy, and hyponatremia were toxicities caused by ipilimumab. The main 
      adverse effect associated with both the PD-1 inhibitors was AIN. The onset of 
      kidney injury seen with PD-1 inhibitors is usually late (3-10 months) compared to 
      CTLA-4 antagonists related renal injury, which happens earlier (2-3 months). PD-1 
      as opposed to CTLA-4 inhibitors has been associated with kidney rejection in 
      transplantation. Steroids appear to be effective in treating the immune-related 
      adverse effects noted with these agents. Key Message: Although initially thought 
      to be rare, the incidence rates of renal toxicities might be higher (9.9-29%) as 
      identified by recent studies. As a result, obtaining knowledge about renal 
      toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitors is extremely important.

TI  - Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for systemic therapy-naïve and -experienced 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 2631-2643
LID - 10.1007/s00262-022-03185-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib combined with pembrolizumab showed a promising result in 
      an early phase study for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The efficacy and safety 
      of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for patients with unresectable HCC (uHCC) beyond 
      the first-line setting were unclear. METHODS: Seventy-one consecutive patients 
      who received lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for uHCC were prospectively enrolled. 
      Effect of lenvatinib combinations on Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score and factors 
      associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 71 cases, 58 (81.7%) were in BCLC C. There were 44 
      (62%) for the first-line systemic treatment, and 27 (38%) had experienced 
      targeted therapy or nivolumab treatment. The objective response rate and disease 
      control rate (DCR) were 34.1% and 84.1% for the first-line setting, and 18.5% and 
      70.4% for systemic therapy-experienced cases (Response Evaluation Criteria in 
      Solid Tumors version 1.1, RECIST v1.1), respectively. The mean ALBI score was 
      stable during the treatment course. After a median of 9.3 months of follow-up, 
      the median PFS was 9.3 months versus 4.4 months, and the median OS was not 
      estimable yet versus 12 months for Child-Pugh A versus B patients, respectively. 
      Prior nivolumab failure was the only significant factor associated with poorer 
      PFS (HR = 3.253, p = 0.004). Child-Pugh class B (HR = 2.646, p = 0.039) and prior 
      nivolumab failure (HR = 3.340, p = 0.014) were independent factors for poorer OS 
      in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A high DCR was observed by 
      lenvatinib/pembrolizumab combination without adverse effect on ALBI score for 
      systemic therapy-naïve and -experienced uHCC. Suboptimal response to prior 
      nivolumab-failed patients requires further exploration.

TI  - Taxane-Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity.
PG  - 152-169
LID - 10.3390/toxics3020152 [doi]
AB  - Taxane-derived agents are chemotherapy drugs widely employed in cancer treatment. 
      Among them, paclitaxel and docetaxel are most commonly administered, but newer 
      formulations are being investigated. Taxane antineoplastic activity is mainly 
      based on the ability of the drugs to promote microtubule assembly, leading to 
      mitotic arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Peripheral neurotoxicity is the 
      major non-hematological adverse effect of taxane, often manifested as painful 
      neuropathy experienced during treatment, and it is sometimes irreversible. 
      Unfortunately, taxane-induced neurotoxicity is an uncertainty prior to the 
      initiation of treatment. The present review aims to dissect current knowledge on 
      real incidence, underlying pathophysiology, clinical features and predisposing 
      factors related with the development of taxane-induced neuropathy.

TI  - Anti-cancer agent-induced nephrotoxicity.
PG  - 921-7
AB  - Patients with cancer are frequently exposed to risk of renal injuries associated 
      with disease-related or iatrogenic causes. Nephrotoxicity is a potential adverse 
      effect of anti-cancer agents and may result in a variety of functional 
      abnormalities, including glomerular or tubular dysfunction, hypertension and 
      disturbance of the renal endocrine function. In this review article, we 
      comprehensively discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, prevention and 
      management of anti-cancer agent-induced renal dysfunction. We focus on both 
      relatively new anti-cancer agents (bevacizumab, gefitinib, gemcitabine, imatinib, 
      rituximab and trastuzumab) and traditional agents (cisplatin, methotrexate, 
      ifosfamide and taxanes) to cover a selection of the most frequently used 
      anti-cancer agents. Increased understanding of the mechanism of renal injury by 
      these agents is considered to be important for developing novel anti-cancer 
      agents that have far fewer adverse effects on kidneys.

AB  - Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), an anti-PD-1 antibody used in the treatment of several 
      different malignancies has been identified to cause adverse effects pertaining to 
      multiple body systems which include respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, 
      and endocrine manifestations known as immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). Skin 
      manifestations have been most described in current literature highlighting the 
      most common adverse effects of this agent. However, adverse outcomes involving 
      the oral mucosa have been rarely identified in the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor 
      classes of immunotherapeutic agents. We present a case of a 71-year-old male who 
      was treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen including pembrolizumab for newly 
      diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, who later developed ulcerations on 
      his tongue that were consistent with glossitis. Upon determining that this 
      adverse effect may be immune-related, the patient was treated with oral 
      prednisone 40 mg with a 10 mg taper each subsequent week, which resulted in 
      significant improvement in the patient's symptoms following one month of 
      treatment.

TI  - Docetaxel-associated epiphora.
PG  - 853-67
AB  - Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane indicated for the treatment of advanced 
      breast, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancers; it is also used for the 
      treatment of various other solid tumors. The standard intermittent dosage of 
      docetaxel is 60-100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. At this dose and schedule, 
      myelosuppression is common and neutropenia is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. 
      Weekly administration of docetaxel 20-42 mg/m2 is being tested in the treatment 
      of advanced solid tumors in order to improve patient tolerance by reducing the 
      interval dose and to maintain therapeutic efficacy by increasing overall dose 
      intensity. Asthenia and peripheral neuropathy can limit continued administration 
      of weekly docetaxel. Epiphora (excess tearing due to narrowing or blockage of the 
      lacrimal outflow passages) is associated with repeated weekly administration of 
      docetaxel. This adverse effect can interfere with activities of daily life and 
      negatively affect quality of life. Epiphora may be an underreported adverse 
      effect of treatment because of underrecognition by clinicians and patient 
      embarrassment with respect to seemingly uncontrolled tearing. The use of weekly 
      docetaxel administration is expanding; therefore, patients should be educated to 
      recognize and report signs and symptoms of epiphora. It is important for 
      clinicians participating in the care of patients undergoing treatment with 
      docetaxel to monitor for excess tearing and signs of eye irritation to ensure 
      timely management of treatment-related epiphora.

TI  - Effect of Exercise on Taxane Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Women 
      With Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting 
      adverse effect of taxanes. We sought to evaluate the effect of exercise on taxane 
      CIPN in women with breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (n = 27) were 
      randomized to immediate exercise (IE, during taxane chemotherapy) or delayed 
      exercise (DE, after chemotherapy). Supervised aerobic, resistance, and balance 
      training was offered 3 days a week for 8-12 weeks. CIPN symptoms and quality of 
      life were assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
      Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30 and CIPN20 (scored from 0 to 
      100). The percentage of participants reporting moderate to severe sensory 
      symptoms ('3/4' or '4/4' for CIPN20 sensory items) was also evaluated, along with 
      clinical sensory testing at the lower limb (vibration sense and pinprick). Taxane 
      treatment adherence, including relative dose intensity, was extracted from 
      patient medical records. Assessments occurred at: baseline (before taxane 
      chemotherapy), pre-cycle 4 (before the final taxane cycle), the end of 
      chemotherapy, and follow-up (10-15 weeks after chemotherapy). RESULTS: No 
      differences in the EORTC QLQ CIPN20 symptom scores were detected between groups 
      at any time point. At pre-cycle 4, there was a significant difference between 
      groups in patient-reported moderate to severe numbness in the toes or feet (IE: n 
      = 1, 9%, DE: n = 7, 50%, P = .04) and impaired vibration sense in the feet (IE: n 
      = 2, 18%, DE: n = 10, 83%, P < .01). Overall global health status/quality of life 
      was higher in IE compared to DE at the end of chemotherapy (P = .05), yet both 
      groups had worse CIPN20 sensory (Δ24.3 ± 4.6, P < .01) and motor symptom scores 
      (Δ10.5 ± 1.9, P < .01) relative to baseline. By the end of chemotherapy, no 
      differences between groups were found for moderate to severe numbness in the toes 
      or feet (P = 1.0) or impaired vibration sense in the feet (P = .71). More IE 
      participants received ≥ 85% relative dose intensity (IE: n = 12, 100%, DE: n = 
      10, 67%, P < .05). CONCLUSION: Exercise may attenuate CIPN over the course of 
      taxane chemotherapy and possibly improve taxane adherence in women with breast 
      cancer. These findings, as well as whether exercise can attenuate CIPN by the end 
      of taxane chemotherapy, should be confirmed in larger trials.

AB  - In recent years, the incidence of breast cancer has been increasing on an annual 
      basis. Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) is overexpressed in 
      15-20% human breast cancers, which is associated with poor prognosis and a high 
      recurrence rate. Trastuzumab is the first humanized monoclonal antibody against 
      HER-2. The most significant adverse effect of trastuzumab is cardiotoxicity, 
      which has become an important factor in limiting the safe use of the drug. 
      Unfortunately, the mechanism causing this cardiotoxicity is still not completely 
      understood, and the use of preventive interventions remains controversial. This 
      article focuses on trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, reviewing the clinical 
      application, potential cardiotoxicity, mechanism and discussing the potential 
      interventions through summarizing related researches over the past tens of years.

TI  - Systemic therapy emergencies.
PG  - 347-61
AB  - Systemic oncologic therapies can cause multiple emergency situations. There are, 
      however, two unique emergencies directly related to chemotherapy administration: 
      drug extravasation and hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Most drugs can cause 
      varying degrees of local tissue injury when extravasated. The medical management 
      of extravasation is based on proper maintenance of the intravenous line, 
      application of local cooling or warming for certain extravasations, and the use 
      of antidotes to prevent the local toxic action of the extravasated drug. 
      Antidotes that appear useful include hyaluronidase (for vinca alkaloids, 
      epipodophyllotoxins, and paclitaxel), sodium thiosulfate (for mechlorethamine and 
      cisplatin), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (for anthracyclines and mitomycin C). 
      HSRs, another potential adverse effect of chemotherapy administration, are a 
      major concern for therapy with taxanes and with L-asparaginase, and their 
      administration requires the use of premedication to prevent these reactions. Once 
      a HSR has occurred, therapy may be continued by using an analog drug or by the 
      administration of premedication as prophylaxis, in particular if the reaction was 
      minor. On the other hand, it is also pertinent to become acquainted with the 
      emergencies induced by biological agents, taking into consideration their 
      increasing usages. In addition to interferons and interleukin-2 (IL-2), both of 
      which have been in clinical use for several years, cytokine-toxin fusion proteins 
      (DAB3891L-2) and two monoclonal antibodies (rituximab and trastuzumab) were 
      recently approved for cancer therapy. The distinct toxicity profiles of these 
      agents are reviewed.

TI  - The effect of docetaxel on developing oedema in patients with breast cancer: a 
      systematic review.
PG  - 269-79
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12261 [doi]
AB  - Docetaxel is extensively used in chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer. 
      Little attention has been given to oedema as a possible side effect of 
      docetaxel-containing therapies. Until now, no review was conducted to evaluate 
      docetaxel-containing therapies versus docetaxel-free therapies on the magnitude 
      of the risk of developing oedema. In this systematic review, we investigated the 
      risk of developing oedema in patients being treated for breast cancer with or 
      without docetaxel. In this systematic literature review, we searched PubMed and 
      Web of Knowledge for studies on breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy 
      containing docetaxel. We included clinical trials comparing docetaxel versus 
      docetaxel-free chemotherapy. Oedema had to be reported and measured as a key 
      outcome or an adverse effect. Methodological checklists were used to assess the 
      risk of bias within the selected studies. Seven randomised clinical trials were 
      included. Six trials were of moderate methodological quality. All trials showed 
      an increased rate of oedema in the docetaxel-treatment arm. The trial of weakest 
      methodological quality reported the highest incidence of oedema. The results 
      moderately suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy containing docetaxel is related to 
      a significantly increased risk of developing oedema, compared with docetaxel-free 
      chemotherapy.

AB  - Cancer remains a major public health problem worldwide and was responsible for 
      9.6 million deaths in 2018. Oncologic treatments such as doxorubicin (Dox) and 
      trastuzumab (Trz) are chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat several types of 
      cancer, including solid and non-solid malignancies. Although these drugs have a 
      significant impact on the reduction in mortality of cancer patients, this 
      treatment has an adverse effect on the cardiovascular system. The mechanisms 
      associated with Dox-induced cardiotoxicity involve inflammation, oxidative 
      stress, apoptosis, mitochondria impairment and dysregulation of autophagy. 
      Unfortunately, Trz, an effective anti-cancer drug, can potentiate these adverse 
      effects. Trz is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody against 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Despite its high anti-cancer 
      efficacy, Trz also has a cardiotoxic effect. Unlike Dox, this adverse effect of 
      Trz on the heart is mostly reversible. A strategy to prevent this undesirable 
      effect is urgently needed. Currently, several pharmacological interventions have 
      shown promising results that might effectively attenuate Dox- and Trz-induced 
      cardiac dysfunction. In this review, reports from in vitro, in vivo and clinical 
      studies pertinent to the underlying mechanisms involved in chemotherapy-induced 
      cardiotoxicity, are comprehensively summarized and discussed. In addition, the 
      potential pharmacological interventions to prevent these cardiotoxic effects are 
      described.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic agents directed against human epidermal growth 
      factor receptor 2 (HER-2) have significantly improved the prognosis of patients 
      who are positive for this receptor. However, cardiomyopathy remains as a common 
      adverse effect of using these agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search 
      was conducted via PubMed using the keywords of "Trastuzumab Cardiomyopathy," 
      "Lapatinib Cardiomyopathy" and "Pertuzumab Cardiomyopathy," which provided 104 
      results. These articles were then screened for relevance to the targeted subject 
      based on their title and abstracts. Case reports and articles that were not 
      discussing any aspect of cardiomyopathy secondary to targeted therapy for breast 
      cancer and articles not in English were eliminated. After elimination, a 
      bibliography search among selected articles was done and a total of 46 articles 
      were identified. The collected articles were then meticulously analyzed and 
      summarized. RESULTS: The use of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) 
      receptor targeted chemotherapy in breast cancer is limited because of a higher 
      incidence (19-22%) of cardiomyopathy. The incidence of cardiomyopathy is not dose 
      dependent and in most cases it is reversible after discontinuation of the drug 
      and treatment with heart failure medications. Severe adverse outcomes including 
      death or permanent disability are rare. CONCLUSION: HER-2 targeted chemotherapy 
      for breast cancer has a higher incidence of associated reversible cardiomyopathy. 
      Patients should be monitored by serial echocardiography starting at the beginning 
      of the treatment and followed by every 3 months until the completion of 
      chemotherapy. Co-ordination between oncologists and cardiologists is needed to 
      develop evidence-based protocols to prevent, identify, monitor and treat 
      trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Cancer immunotherapy significantly contributed to an improvement in the prognosis 
      of cancer patients. Immunotherapy, including human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and 
      chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T), share the characteristic to exploit 
      the capabilities of the immune system to kill cancerous cells. Trastuzumab is a 
      monoclonal antibody against HER2 that prevents HER2-mediated signaling; it is 
      administered mainly in HER2-positive cancers, such as breast, colorectal, biliary 
      tract, and non-small-cell lung cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) 
      inhibit the binding of CTLA-4 or PD-1 to PDL-1, allowing T cells to kill 
      cancerous cells. ICI can be used in melanomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, 
      urothelial, and head and neck cancer. There are two main types of T-cell transfer 
      therapy: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (or TIL) therapy and chimeric antigen 
      receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cell therapy, mainly applied for B-cell lymphoma and 
      leukemia and mantle-cell lymphoma. HER2-targeted therapies, mainly trastuzumab, 
      are associated with left ventricular dysfunction, usually reversible and rarely 
      life-threatening. PD/PDL-1 inhibitors can cause myocarditis, rare but potentially 
      fulminant and associated with a high fatality rate. CAR-T therapy is associated 
      with several cardiac toxic effects, mainly in the context of a systemic adverse 
      effect, the cytokines release syndrome.

PG  - 356-68
AB  - Docetaxel, a promising inhibitor of microtubule depolymerization has shown 
      significant anti-cancer activity during phase I and early phase II trials. The 
      recommended dosage for phase II trials is 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks which provides 
      optimal activity with tolerable adverse effects. Docetaxel has shown high single 
      agent activity including use as first- or second-line therapy and in 
      anthracycline refractory breast cancer patients. Results have been comparable to 
      that of established treatments for breast cancer. In addition, docetaxel has 
      shown significant activity in non-small cell lung cancer and a range of other 
      tumors, but no activity in renal or colo-rectal tumors. At present it is 
      undergoing further evaluation in combination therapy. The safety profile of 
      docetaxel is well defined. Major adverse effects include hypersensitivity 
      reactions, fluid retention and neutropenia. Peripheral neuropathy is not a 
      significant adverse effect. The aims of phase II trials with regard to 
      counteracting side-effects are therefore 2-fold: firstly, to evaluate the use of 
      premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines as a means of counteracting 
      hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retention; secondly, to determine whether 
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor may be useful for attenuating neutropenia.

TI  - Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide-Induced Phototherapy Recall.
PG  - 569-570
AB  - Phototherapy recall can occur unexpectedly as a result of treatment with commonly 
      used medications and chemotherapy. These reactions are rare. The recall reaction 
      is an inflammatory response that is triggered by many medications. 
      Cyclophosphamide and docetaxel are widely used chemotherapeutic agents that are 
      useful in the management of many different malignancies. The pathophysiology of 
      phototherapy recall is not clearly understood. This case highlights the need for 
      practitioners to be aware of this potential reaction, even though UV exposure may 
      have occurred in the distant past. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the 
      first phototherapy recall dermatitis that occurred years after UV exposure 
      induced by cyclophosphamide and docetaxel. The frequency of administration of 
      this drug and the profound implications of this adverse effect make this case an 
      important contribution to the medical literature.

TI  - Hand-foot syndrome induced by chemotherapy drug: Case series study and literature 
      review.
PG  - 208-215
LID - 10.4103/ijp.ijp_175_21 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy drugs can be responsible of several side effects such 
      as hand-foot syndrome (HFS). This syndrome is also called "palmar-plantar 
      erythrodysesthesia" and "acral erythema." Without proper management, it can 
      deteriorate the quality of life of a patient, leading to temporary or definitive 
      stop of chemotherapy. AIM OF THIS STUDY: To identify the epidemiological and 
      clinical characteristics of patients, the risk factors for occurrence and 
      worsening of this syndrome, and the drugs most likely to be responsible of HFS. 
      METHODS: Our study was retrospective, including 42 patients with HFS secondary to 
      a chemotherapy drug. These cases were notified to the National Center of 
      Pharmacovigilance over 7 years. The severity of HFS has been classified according 
      to the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 classification. RESULTS: Our population was composed of 40 
      women and 2 men. The mean age was 51 years. Docetaxel was the main drug 
      associated with this adverse effect. Hands were involved in all cases and were 
      sometimes associated with other skin surfaces apart from feet. Erythema of the 
      hands and/or feet was present in all patients; it was associated with edema in 
      more than half of the cases. The distribution of different grades according to 
      the NCI-CTCAE classification among the patients was almost equal: 28% Grade 1, 
      36% Grade 2, and 36% Grade 3. HFS occurred mainly after the first course of 
      chemotherapy with a mean period of 3-4 days. The regression of HFS occurred more 
      rapidly for Grade 1 and Grade 2 compared with Grade 3, especially when assisted 
      by symptomatic treatment. The recurrence rate of HFS for those patients with 
      decreased doses, spacing of cures, and/or symptomatic and prophylaxis treatment 
      was 25%. CONCLUSION: An early detection of HFS, associated with preventive 
      measures, enables patients to continue the chemotherapy.

TI  - Nail toxicity induced by cancer chemotherapy.
PG  - 143-55
LID - 10.1177/1078155208100450 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To provide a comprehensive literature review of chemotherapy-induced 
      nail toxicity, including clinical presentation, implicated drugs and approaches 
      for prevention and management. DATA SOURCE: A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE 
      (1966-2008) databases was conducted using the terms (and variations of the terms) 
      antineoplastic agents, nails, nail toxicity, onycholysis, and paronychia. 
      Bibliographies from selected articles were reviewed for appropriate references. 
      DATA EXTRACTION: The retrieved literature was reviewed to include all articles 
      relevant to the clinical presentation, diagnosis, incidence, prevention, and 
      treatment of chemotherapy-induced nail toxicity. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nail toxicity is 
      a relatively uncommon adverse effect linked to a number of chemotherapeutic 
      agents. Clinical presentation varies, depending on which nail structure is 
      affected and the severity of the insult. Nail changes may involve all or some 
      nails. Toxicity may be asymptomatic and limited to cosmetic concerns, however, 
      more severe effects, involving pain and discomfort can occur. Taxanes and 
      anthracyclines are the antineoplastic drug groups most commonly implicated. It is 
      suggested that the administration schedule may influence the incidence of nail 
      abnormalities, for example reported cases linked to the weekly administration of 
      paclitaxel.Before instituting chemotherapy, patients should be educated regarding 
      potential nail toxicities and strategies for prevention implemented. Management 
      includes appropriate nail cutting, avoiding potential irritants, topical, or oral 
      antimicrobials, and possibly cessation or dose reduction of the offending agent. 
      Cryotherapy, through the application of frozen gloves or socks, has been 
      beneficial in reducing docetaxel-induced nail toxicity and may be effective for 
      other drugs.

TI  - Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin Sequential Administration Increases Oxidative Stress 
      and Phosphorylation of Connexin 43 on Ser368.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23126375 [doi]
LID - 6375
AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed in up to 30% of 
      breast cancer cases, causing a more aggressive tumour growth and poor prognosis. 
      Trastuzumab, the humanized antibody targeted to HER2, increased the life 
      expectancy of patients, but severe cardiotoxicity emerged as a long-term adverse 
      effect. Clinical evidence highlights that Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity 
      drastically increases in association with Doxorubicin; however, the exact 
      mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. In order to analyse the 
      molecular mechanisms involved and the possible adaptative responses to 
      Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin treatment, in this study, H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were 
      used. Results showed that Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin sequential administration 
      in cardiomyoblast increased cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS production, 
      intracellular calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and 
      the consequent apoptosis, induced by both Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin alone. 
      Furthermore, in these conditions, we observed increased levels of Connexin43 
      phosphorylated on Ser368 (pCx43). Since phosphorylation on Ser368 decreases gap 
      junction intracellular communication, thus reducing the spread of death signals 
      to adjacent cells, we hypothesized that the increase in pCx43 could be an 
      adaptative response implemented by cells to defend neighbouring cells by 
      Trastuzumab and Doxorubicin sequential administration. However, the other side of 
      the coin is the resulting conduction abnormalities.

TI  - Lapatinib: a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor for metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 1703-10
LID - 10.2146/ajhp070646 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, 
      drug and food interactions, dosage and administration, and role in therapy of 
      lapatinib in metastatic breast cancer are reviewed. SUMMARY: Lapatinib is a 
      small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that dually targets human epidermal 
      growth factor receptors 1 and 2 (HER2). Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib enters the 
      cell and binds to the intracellular domain of the tyrosine kinase receptor, 
      allowing for complete blockage of the autophosphorylation reaction and a complete 
      halt to the downstream cascade of events. After oral administration, lapatinib 
      reaches peak plasma levels within approximately 4 hours, steady-state levels 
      within six to seven days, and has a half-life of 24 hours. Combination therapy 
      with lapatinib and capecitabine has demonstrated superior time to progression 
      compared with capecitabine monotherapy for the treatment of HER2-positive 
      metastatic breast cancer refractory to anthracycline-, taxane-, and 
      trastuzumab-containing regimens. Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib is an orally 
      active agent with promising clinical activity in metastatic breast cancer and is 
      associated with a better adverse-effect profile. The most frequently reported 
      adverse events in patients receiving combination therapy with lapatinib and 
      capecitabine were diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome. Ongoing research has further 
      evaluated the safety of lapatinib regarding cardiac effects and found that the 
      majority of left ventricular ejection fraction decreases from baseline were 
      asymptomatic and reversible. CONCLUSION: Lapatinib has demonstrated efficacy in 
      combination with capecitabine in patients with previously treated HER2-positive 
      metastatic breast cancer. In patients with metastatic disease refractory to 
      trastuzumab-, anthracycline-, and taxane-containing regimens, the addition of 
      lapatinib to capecitabine may extend the time to disease progression and 
      progression-free survival.

TI  - Treatment of head and neck cancers: issues for clinical pharmacists.
PG  - 578-92
LID - 10.1592/phco.29.5.578 [doi]
AB  - Head and neck cancers are a heterogeneous group of diseases involving the oral 
      cavity, pharyngeal tube, and larynx. Given the drug therapy options available, 
      clinical pharmacists can play an important role in the care of this patient 
      population. They can recommend a regimen based on efficacy, toxicity, and 
      patient-specific factors; ensure that the prescribed regimen has been studied and 
      reported in the literature; verify dosages; and monitor and counsel patients 
      about adverse effects. Chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation) is often the 
      standard treatment for patients with stage III or nonmetastatic stage IV head and 
      neck cancer. Cisplatin-based regimens are preferred, although carboplatin may be 
      appropriate in some circumstances. Induction therapy with a docetaxel-based 
      regimen is recommended for some patients; however, this therapy has been 
      associated with a high frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and febrile 
      neutropenia. Cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, is the 
      newest agent approved for treatment of head and neck cancer. Although evidence 
      supports cetuximab combined with cisplatin versus cisplatin alone for patients 
      with metastatic disease, the role of combination therapy is less clear in 
      patients undergoing chemoradiation. Patients with head and neck cancer may 
      experience swallowing difficulties or mouth pain, possibly interfering with drug 
      administration and adherence; thus, pharmacists in all practice settings should 
      be knowledgeable about different regimens and alternative routes of 
      administration. Xerostomia and mucositis are common adverse effects of radiation 
      therapy, and it is critical that good oral hygiene practices are maintained. 
      Patients may achieve symptomatic relief from xerostomia with saliva substitutes, 
      and clinical experience suggests that use of pilocarpine is worthwhile. Until 
      more evidence becomes available, prevention of xerostomia and mucositis with 
      amifostine is still controversial. Salt-water rinses, bioadherent oral gel, and 
      honey are relatively inexpensive and nontoxic agents for managing mucositis. 
      Because of the expense of palifermin, it is best reserved for refractory cases. 
      Skin toxicities are common with radiation. Rash is also a common adverse effect 
      of cetuximab. When used together, they may produce complicated skin toxicities. 
      It is important to become familiar with the grading of these rashes so that 
      appropriate therapy can be recommended. As pharmacotherapy for head and neck 
      cancers continues to evolve, clinical pharmacists will continue to have an 
      important role in optimizing treatment for patients by balancing efficacy and 
      toxicity.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of docetaxel in clinical trials.
PG  - S19-24
AB  - The efficacy and safety of docetaxel in clinical trials in patients with a 
      variety of malignancies are reviewed. The overall response rate for docetaxel as 
      a first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer is 59%. Docetaxel in 
      combination with doxorubicin or vinorelbine has proved particularly effective in 
      the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Docetaxel is also one of 
      the most active single agents in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC), producing an overall response rate of 27% when used as a first-line 
      agent. Docetaxel plus cisplatin was more effective against NSCLC than either drug 
      used alone, yielding response rates of 33-48%. Docetaxel has shown activity 
      against a variety of other tumors, including ovarian cancer (response rate in 
      second-line therapy, 34%), head-and-neck cancer (response rate in first-line 
      therapy, 35%), and soft-tissue sarcoma (response rate in first-line therapy, 
      32%). The main toxic effect is grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurs in 57% of 
      treatment cycles but is brief and manageable. The dosage of docetaxel should be 
      reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 if patients have neutropenia lasting more than 
      one week, febrile neutropenia, or impaired liver function. Other adverse effects 
      include severe fluid retention and asthenia. Some adverse effects can be avoided 
      by administering corticosteroid premedication. Docetaxel has shown efficacy 
      against a wide range of cancers in clinical trials and has a manageable 
      adverse-effect profile.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid tumours and the 
      second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Advanced-recurrent 
      HCC often requires a systemic drug therapy where multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 
      Sorafenib represents the first-line therapy option. But it exhibited very limited 
      survival benefit and tumour response due to the early emergence of drug 
      resistance and drug-related adverse effect. Immunotherapy approaches now being 
      widely studied as an effective alternative treatment for HCC. Several immune 
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, are approved as 
      monotherapy in sorafenib-resistant HCC patients. But, the existence of a plethora 
      of immunosuppressive signals in the tumour microenvironment often leads to 
      unsuccessful immunotherapies. In this context, combinatorial immunotherapies are 
      getting much acceptance as a way to improve therapeutic outcomes by blocking 
      immunosuppressive signals in the tumour microenvironment (TME). The combination 
      of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors with ICI resulted in 
      significant synergistic effects in various preclinical and clinical studies. 
      However, the adverse effects associated with current synthetic VEGF inhibitors 
      limit its clinical utility. In this review, we have summarized the potential of 
      phytochemicals, especially the category of flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, 
      terpenoids, and coumarin, as the available-affordable-safe-effective repositories 
      of VEGF inhibitors. Their possibilities as an alternative for synthetic VEGF 
      inhibitors by synergistic combination with ICI are reviewed, thereby enhancing 
      patient compliance and survival rates. This review highlights the demand for a 
      detailed investigation of the plausible role of plant-based 
      anti-angiogenic-immunotherapy combination against HCC.

AB  - Neurologic complications of conventional cytototxic agents as well as those from 
      monoclonal antibodies and targeted therapies are increasingly observed in 
      patients with cancer. The major categories are represented by alkylating agents 
      (platinum compounds, ifosfamide, procarbazine, thiotepa), mitotic spindle 
      inhibitors (vinca alkaloids, taxanes, etoposide, teniposide), proteasome 
      inhibitors (bortezomib), antibiotics, antimetabolites, thalidomide, lenalidomide, 
      topoisomerase inhibitors, interferon-α, hormones, bevacizumab, trastuzumab, and 
      small tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Peripheral neuropathy is a common adverse 
      effect of a number of chemotherapeutic drugs and often represents a critical 
      factor limiting an adequate dose-intensity of chemotherapy. Regarding the central 
      nervous system (CNS), it is vulnerable to many forms of toxicity from 
      chemotherapeutic agents, including encephalopathy syndromes and confusional 
      states, seizures, headache, cerebrovascular complications, visual loss, 
      cerebellar syndromes, and myelopathy. For a given drug, the occurrence of CNS 
      toxicity depends on several factors, including the total dose, route of 
      administration, presence of structural brain lesions, exposure to prior or 
      concurrent irradiation, and interactions with other drugs. However, many of the 
      neurotoxic reactions are rare and idiosyncratic, and remain unpredictable. 
      Several forms of neuroprotection and rehabilitation are being investigated. Last, 
      the so-called "chemobrain" is an emerging issue, as it is a model of a subtle of 
      and long-lasting damage to neuronal structures from some antineoplastic agents.

PG  - 227-239

AB  - Introduction: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is an adverse effect of several classes 
      of chemotherapy including the taxanes. Predictive PN biomarkers could inform 
      individualized taxane treatment to reduce PN and enhance therapeutic outcomes. 
      Pharmacogenetics studies of taxane-induced PN have focused on genes involved in 
      pharmacokinetics, including enzymes and transporters. Contradictory findings from 
      these studies prevent translation of genetic biomarkers into clinical practice. 
      Areas covered: This review discusses the progress toward identifying 
      pharmacogenetic predictors of PN by assessing the evidence for two independent 
      associations; the effect of pharmacogenetics on taxane pharmacokinetics and the 
      evidence that taxane pharmacokinetics affects PN. Assessing these direct 
      relationships allows the reader to understand the progress toward individualized 
      taxane treatment and future research opportunities. Expert opinion: Paclitaxel 
      pharmacokinetics is a major determinant of PN. Additional clinical trials are 
      needed to confirm the clinical benefit of individualized dosing to achieve target 
      paclitaxel exposure. Genetics does not meaningfully contribute to paclitaxel 
      pharmacokinetics and may not be useful to inform dosing. However, genetics may 
      contribute to PN sensitivity and could be useful for estimating patients' optimal 
      paclitaxel exposure. For docetaxel, genetics has not been demonstrated to have a 
      meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics and there is no evidence that 
      pharmacokinetics determines PN.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-patients treated with standard 
      chemotherapy experienced progression rapidly. A novel therapy based on programed 
      death 1 (PD-1)/programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors showed an increasing 
      potential in several malignancies including advanced NSCLC. OBJECTIVES: This 
      article is a meta-analysis aiming to systematically evaluate the efficacy and 
      safety profiles of PD-1/PD-L1 agents in patients with NSCLC. DATA SOURCES: Data 
      were collected from eligible studies searched from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web 
      of Science. SYNTHESIS METHODS: Pooled hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) 
      and progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated to assess the efficacy of 
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors versus docetaxel, pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated for 
      objective response rate (ORR). The overall frequency was estimated for 1-year OS, 
      1-year progression-free survival, and ORR. A subgroup analysis among NSCLC 
      patients tested with different epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status was 
      also performed to figure out the relationship between EGFR status and efficacy of 
      PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. OR for occurrence of any grade and grade 3 to 5 
      treatment-related adverse effect was calculated for evaluating the safety of 
      PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this analysis. The 
      pooled HRs for OS and PFS were 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.75) and 
      0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.91), respectively, the pooled OR for ORR was 1.83 (95% CI 
      1.41-2.36), indicating a significant improvement in OS, PFS, and ORR. In the 
      results of subgroup analysis, the HR for OS in NSCLC patients was 1.05 (95% CI 
      0.69-1.59) in patients with mutant EGFR and 0.66 (95% CI 0.57-0.77) in patients 
      with wild-type EGFR status. OR for occurrence was 0.36 (95% CI 0.28-0.46) in any 
      grade treatment-related adverse effect and 0.18 (95% CI 0.14-0.22) in grade 3 to 
      5 treatment-related adverse effect, suggesting a superior safety profile of 
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: The PD-1/PD-L1 therapy significantly prolonged 
      the OS and improved the ORR, simultaneously lowering the treatment-related 
      adverse effect events versus docetaxel.

TI  - The benefits and risks of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as 
      first-line therapy in small-cell lung cancer: a single-arm meta-analysis of 
      noncomparative clinical studies and randomized control trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although pembrolizumab has shown clinical benefit in patients with 
      small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), its actual efficacy in combination with a 
      conventional chemotherapy drug has not been determined. We performed this study 
      to discern the efficacy and risk of pembrolizumab in combination with 
      chemotherapy as first-line therapy in SCLC patients. METHODS: We systematically 
      searched the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, 
      Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases for relevant studies. The 
      main outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). 
      RESULTS: We identified 2980 articles and included 6 studies (5 were 
      noncomparative open-label studies and 1 was a randomized controlled trial [RCT]) 
      involving 396 patients in our meta-analysis. The pooled median OS (mOS) was 9.6 
      months (95% CI, 8.0-11.2), and the pooled median PFS (mPFS) was 4.2 months (95% 
      CI, 2.2-6.1). The 1-year overall survival rate (OSR-1y) and 6-month 
      progression-free survival rate (PFSR-6m) were 45.1% (95% CI, 33-57.2%) and 41.6% 
      (95% CI, 24.3-59%), respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) was 38.8% 
      (95% CI, 11.9-65.67%), disease control rate (DCR) was 69.30% (95% CI, 
      51.6-87.0%), complete response (CR) was 2.20% (95% CI, 0.8-3.7%), partial 
      response (PR) was 34.70% (95% CI, 7.8-61.5%), and stable disease (SD) was 20.90% 
      (95% CI, 9.1-32.6%). The grade 3-4 adverse effect (AE) rate was 20.88% (95% CI, 
      1.22-54.85%). The most common AEs were neutropenia (90.16%), anemia (53.21%), 
      dysphagia (41.96%), platelet count decrease (34.87%), and esophagitis (32.89%); 
      severe AEs included neutropenia, respiratory failure, pneumonitis, acute coronary 
      syndrome, and colitis/intestinal ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 
      pembrolizumab with conventional chemotherapy is an effective therapeutic schedule 
      with acceptable and manageable efficacy and toxicity in patients with SCLC. More 
      high-quality and well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes are warranted to 
      further validate our findings.

TI  - Systemic Therapy for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Update of a Rapidly 
      Evolving Field.
PG  - 588-596
LID - 10.1016/j.jceh.2019.07.012 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence and mortality have shown an unfavorable 
      upward trend over the last two decades, especially in developed countries. More 
      than one-sixth of the patients have advanced HCC at presentation. Systemic 
      therapy remains the treatment of choice for these patients. Current options 
      include tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immunotherapy. This review aims to 
      summarize current knowledge on the rapidly evolving field of systemic therapy 
      with several newly approved medications over the last year. Sorafenib remains one 
      of the first-line treatment choices for patients with hepatitis C etiology, 
      intermediate to advanced HCC stage, and Child-Pugh class A. Lenvatinib is the 
      other first-line drug that might have better efficacy in non-hepatitis C 
      etiologies and advanced HCC without portal vein thrombosis. Patients intolerant 
      to first-line therapy might benefit from immunotherapy with nivolumab or 
      pembrolizumab. In those who fail first-line therapy, the choice should be based 
      on the side effects related to previous treatment, performance status, and 
      underlying liver dysfunction. Ongoing studies are investigating immunotherapy 
      alone or immunotherapy in combination with TKIs as first-line therapy. Several 
      second-line options for combination systemic therapy and systemic plus 
      local-regional treatment are under investigation. Future studies should focus on 
      identifying reliable biomarkers to predict response to therapy and to better 
      stratify patients at high risk for progression. Multidisciplinary approach is 
      pivotal for successful outcomes in patients with advanced HCC.

TI  - Anti-erbB-2 antibody trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2-amplified breast 
      cancer.
PG  - 391-409
AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2) is a member of a family of 
      four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate cell growth, survival 
      and differentiation via multiple signal transduction pathways. Amplification of 
      the HER2 gene occurs in 20-25% of human breast cancers. This amplification event 
      is an independent adverse prognostic factor as well as a predictive factor for 
      increased response to doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy, response to 
      trastuzumab and decreased response to hormonal therapy. Methods for detecting 
      protein overexpression or gene amplification in clinical tumor specimens include 
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
      techniques, with the latter considered by some to be more accurate. Trastuzumab 
      (Herceptin) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody which targets an 
      epitope in the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Preclinical models 
      demonstrated that this antibody has significant anti-tumor activity as a single 
      agent and has synergy with certain chemotherapeutic drugs. Phase II and III 
      clinical trials performed in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpress 
      HER2 have shown that trastuzumab has clinical activity when used as first-, 
      second- or third-line monotherapy, and improves survival when used as first-line 
      therapy in combination with chemotherapy. Newer combinations with numerous 
      chemotherapeutic drugs have also shown significant clinical activity in phase II 
      studies. In all of these trials, trastuzumab was generally well-tolerated, but 
      cardiac toxicity (particularly when the antibody was combined with 
      anthracyclines) was an unexpected adverse effect. Although trastuzumab is 
      currently usually administered on a weekly intravenous schedule, evidence 
      suggests that a triple dose of the drug given once every three weeks has a 
      pharmacokinetic profile expected to be equally efficacious. Neither the optimal 
      schedule nor the optimal duration of trastuzumab therapy has yet been clearly 
      defined in controlled clinical trials. Current clinical investigations of 
      trastuzumab include its use in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings as well 
      as in combination with other chemotherapy drugs or new biologic targeted agents.

TI  - Docetaxel and irinotecan, alone and in combination, in the treatment of non-small 
      cell lung cancer.
PG  - 32-40; discussion 41-2
AB  - Single-agent activity has been observed for both docetaxel and irinotecan in 
      several solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Compilation 
      of data from phase II trials of single-agent docetaxel therapy in NSCLC yielded 
      overall response rates of 26% and a 1-year survival rate of 52%. Furthermore, a 
      recent study that combined radiotherapy with concurrent docetaxel treatment 
      reported an overall response rate of 77%. The most important adverse effect of 
      docetaxel therapy is neutropenia Phase II trials of single-agent irinotecan for 
      NSCLC patients resulted in response rates of 15% to 31%. The main toxicities were 
      neutropenia and diarrhea. Investigators have begun to explore the efficacy of 
      combining docetaxel and irinotecan. The results of preclinical studies suggest 
      that schedule and order of administration may be important. A Japanese study 
      evaluated the combination in previously untreated patients with NSCLC, and found 
      eight partial responses in 26 patients (32%). A recent phase I study at the Mayo 
      Clinic showed partial responses in three of five patients who received irinotecan 
      followed by docetaxel. In a phase I study conducted at Yale Cancer Center, 
      escalating doses of docetaxel (25 to 40 mg/m2) were given before irinotecan (50 
      mg/m2) for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest. There was one partial response 
      among five evaluable patients with NSCLC (one of four among patients who had 
      received no prior chemotherapy). The results of these studies suggest that the 
      combination of docetaxel and irinotecan shows promise in the treatment of NSCLC. 
      Irinotecan also has been used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. 
      The irinotecan/etoposide combination has been less extensively evaluated but thus 
      far appears to be associated with considerable toxicity, particularly 
      myelosuppression, without clear therapeutic advantage. One report of the use of 
      the triple combination of irinotecan/cisplatin/etoposide resulted in 16 partial 
      responses in 42 NSCLC patients (38%). Like docetaxel, irinotecan has been used 
      effectively in conjunction with radiation therapy, with partial response rates in 
      some studies of more than 70%.

TI  - Pembrolizumab-associated autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
LID - 10.1136/bcr-2018-229064 [doi]
LID - e229064
AB  - Treatment paradigms have recently changed with the introduction of immunotherapy; 
      autoimmune toxicities that can arise are frequently very different from the more 
      familiar chemotherapy toxicities. We present a clinical case of autoimmune 
      haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) secondary to pembrolizumab occurring in a 73-year-old 
      male patient being treated for lung adenocarcinoma, who had received 13 cycles of 
      pembrolizumab. Treatment was immediately stopped and he was treated with high 
      dose steroids to which he responded both clinically and biochemically. There have 
      been prior reports of immunotherapy-associated AIHA with the use of cytotoxic 
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, but very few 
      reports of programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) inhibitor 
      associated AIHA. We highlight a rare case of AIHA as an adverse effect of 
      pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. Although unusual, it is important to be vigilant 
      for haematological immune-related adverse events.

TI  - Optimizing Patient Outcomes with PD-1/PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for the 
      First-Line Treatment of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
PG  - 239-255
LID - 10.1002/phar.2364 [doi]
AB  - The rapidly expanding repertoire of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) now 
      includes two agents, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, approved for first-line 
      treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) as monotherapy or as 
      part of chemoimmunotherapy. This review summarizes the clinical evidence 
      supporting these indications, with a focus on strategies to optimize patient 
      outcomes. These strategies include patient and tumor factors, adverse-effect 
      profiles, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions, and quality of 
      life and cost-effectiveness considerations. We performed a systematic literature 
      search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, as well as a search 
      of the conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, 
      European Society for Medical Oncology, and American Association for Cancer 
      Research (through August 31, 2019). The addition of ICIs to conventional 
      chemotherapy as first-line treatment against aNSCLC is now part of the standard 
      of care options. However, even though ICIs may be cost-effective in patients with 
      aNSCLC, high drug and other associated costs can still be a barrier to treatment 
      for patients. Moreover, the adverse-effect profiles of ICIs differ significantly 
      from conventional chemotherapy, and some immune-related adverse effects may have 
      a lasting impact on quality of life. Therefore, in adhering to a patient-centered 
      model of care, clinicians should be mindful of patient- and treatment-specific 
      factors when considering therapeutic options for patients with aNSCLC. Although 
      the role of the immune system in cancer progression and regression has not been 
      fully elucidated, the full clinical potential of immunotherapeutics in the 
      treatment of cancer likely remains to be unleashed.

TI  - Lapatinib: a novel dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity in solid tumors.
PG  - 261-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, adverse 
      effects, and drug interactions of lapatinib. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was 
      conducted (1966-August 2005) using the following terms: lapatinib, GW572016, and 
      dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Additional information sources included meeting 
      abstracts, clinical trial data, and bibliographies from articles identified 
      through PubMed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Preclinical and clinical 
      trials that evaluated lapatinib in cell culture, animal models, and human 
      subjects were selected from the data sources. Pivotal in vitro data and all in 
      vivo data published regarding lapatinib were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 
      development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has resulted from a search for targeted 
      cancer therapeutics made possible by recent gains in our understanding of tumor 
      cell biology. Lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for 
      inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor-2 autophosphorylation, leading to suppression of proliferation pathways 
      of solid tumors. Lapatinib has shown clinical activity in solid tumors, with the 
      most notable in advanced or metastatic breast cancer, including tumors refractory 
      to trastuzumab. It has a mild adverse effect profile, with the most common 
      adverse events being diarrhea and rash. CONCLUSIONS: Lapatinib has novel, dual 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties selective for factors overexpressed in some 
      solid tumors. Results from preclinical and Phase I/II trials indicate activity in 
      the treatment of solid tumors, especially advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
      Application for approval is anticipated pending results of ongoing Phase III 
      trials.

TI  - Docetaxel-induced nail dystrophy.
PG  - 293-6
AB  - A 73-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer treated with weekly docetaxel 
      chemotherapy for 5 months developed an acute nail dystrophy restricted to the 
      fingernails. This was characterized by onycholysis, subungual haemorrhage and 
      acute paronychia, progressing to a subungual abscess of the right index finger. 
      Nail bed hyperaemia and haemosiderin-like nail bed discoloration were present. 
      Nail plate avulsion was performed to decompress the acutely painful subungual 
      abscess. The right thumb, middle finger and left index finger demonstrated early, 
      proximal white subungual collections of pus obscuring the lunula (onychophosis). 
      Central nail plate fenestrations with a surgical drill led to exudation of 
      purulent material. Cultures of the subungual abscess material yielded mixed 
      organisms, possibly related to administration of flucloxacillin for 1 week prior 
      to presentation. The patient completed a further two courses of docetaxel without 
      sequelae, and the nail dystrophy appears to be resolving. Docetaxel-induced nail 
      changes are a common adverse effect, occurring in 30-40% of patients. Mild 
      changes do not usually warrant the discontinuation of treatment.

TI  - Second-line treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Prednisone and radiotherapy 
      for symptom relief.
PG  - 74-8
AB  - First-line treatment based on androgen suppression is initially very effective in 
      relieving the symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer. When androgen suppression 
      no longer controls disease progression and symptoms, which treatments are known 
      to improve duration or quality of survival? To answer this question, we reviewed 
      the evidence using the standard Prescrire methodology. Low doses of 
      corticosteroids, such as prednisone 5 to 10 mg per day, appear to improve quality 
      of life for a few months by relieving symptoms in 20% to 40% of patients. When 
      added to prednisone, docetaxel, a cytotoxic drug, tends to be more effective than 
      mitoxantrone in terms of pain relief and quality of life. Docetaxel prolongs 
      survival by about 2 months but provokes severe adverse effects in one-quarter of 
      patients. Adding estramustine to this combination prolongs survival but carries a 
      risk of serious thromboembolic events. Addition of bevacizumab has no proven 
      impact on survival. After failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy with docetaxel, two 
      hormonal treatments, abiraterone and enzalutamide, appear to prolong survival by 
      about 4 or 5 months, and are associated with moderate adverse effects. However, 
      these results are based on only one trial of each drug. Cabazitaxel is also 
      moderately effective in terms of survival but has a less favourable adverse 
      effect profile than abiraterone. A meta-analysis of trials of bisphosphonates 
      used to prevent complications of bone metastases showed no major benefit, 
      including in terms of pain relief. Bisphosphonates are not sufficiently effective 
      to justify exposing patients to their potentially serious adverse effects. In one 
      trial, the harm-benefit balance of denosumab was no better than that of 
      zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate. External beam radiation therapy or intravenous 
      infusion of strontium-89 (a radioisotope) each relieves pain associated with bone 
      metastases in over 70% of cases. If metastatic prostate cancer progresses despite 
      androgen suppression, the two main options in 2012 are either: palliative 
      treatment with corticosteroids and external beam radiation therapy or 
      radioisotope infusion; or docetaxel followed by abiraterone, which slightly 
      prolongs survival but at a cost of sometimes serious adverse effects.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to assess the clinical features of hand-foot 
      syndrome (HFS) associated with certain systemic chemotherapeutic drugs in a 
      real-world setting using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. 
      METHODS: HFS was defined using the preferred terms from the Medical Dictionary 
      for Regulatory Activities. We used several indices, such as the reporting odds 
      ratios (RORs) at 95% confidence interval (CI), the time-to-onset profile of HFS, 
      and cluster analysis. RESULTS: Of 646,779 reports (submission period: April 2004 
      to September 2020), 1814 reported HFS events. The RORs (95% CI) for axitinib, 
      capecitabine, lapatinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, and sunitinib were 14.9 
      (11.1-20.1), 54.6 (49.2-60.6), 130.4 (110.7-153.6), 63.3 (55.2-72.6), 29.0 
      (25.8-32.7), and 13.9 (11.7-16.5), respectively. The analysis of time-to-onset 
      profiles revealed that the median values (interquartile range: 25.0-75.0%) of 
      drug-induced HFS caused by capecitabine, cisplatin, docetaxel, everolimus, 
      regorafenib, sorafenib, and trastuzumab were 21.0 (13.0-42.0), 15.0 (10.0-82.0), 
      6.0 (3.0-25.0), 86.5 (67.0-90.5), 9.0 (6.0-14.0), 9.0 (6.0-14.0), and 70.0 
      (15.0-189.0) days, respectively. The number of clusters was set to 4. Among 
      these, one cluster, which included capecitabine, regorafenib, and lapatinib, 
      exhibited a higher reporting ratio and ROR of drug-induced HFS than other drugs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The RORs and results of time-to-onset analysis obtained in this 
      study indicated the potential risk of HFS associated with chemotherapeutic drugs. 
      Our results suggest that health care professionals must be aware of the potential 
      onset of drug-induced HFS with docetaxel, regorafenib, and sorafenib for at least 
      4 weeks; therefore, careful observation is recommended. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: 
      Elucidation of the relationship between cancer drugs and risk of hand-foot 
      syndrome: Purpose: Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is an adverse effect of some cancer 
      drugs, which is characterized by symptoms such as redness, swelling, blistering, 
      and pain in the area of palms and soles. HFS reduces the quality of life of 
      patients and can sometimes interfere with anticancer treatment plans. It is 
      important to understand the clinical manifestations of HFS and gain knowledge 
      that will allow for early intervention by clinicians.Methods: In this study, we 
      used a large-scale side effect database of real-world cases for a comprehensive 
      investigation of anticancer-drug-induced HFS. The database contained 646,779 
      adverse event reports from April 2004 to September 2020; among which, we 
      identified 1814 HFS events. Using these data, we could obtain information on the 
      relationship between 19 types of anticancer drugs and HFS, and the onset time of 
      HFS and HFS prognosis related to each anticancer drug. Results: Our results 
      suggest that clinicians should monitor the risk of HFS with docetaxel, 
      regorafenib, and sorafenib for at least the first 4 weeks after drug 
      administration. Conclusion: These findings are crucial for improving the 
      management of the adverse effects caused by anticancer drugs.

PG  - 1091-102
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and economic study data for docetaxel, paclitaxel 
      and vinorelbine in the treatment of anthracycline-resistant advanced breast 
      cancer. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov decision-analysis model to simulate 
      the clinical course of a 'typical' patient with advanced breast cancer during 
      salvage chemotherapy was updated with response rates and adverse effect rates 
      from phase III clinical trial data for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine. 
      Costs were taken from UK national databases and hospitals. Utilities were 
      estimated from 30 oncology nurses in the UK using the standard gamble method. 
      PERSPECTIVE: National Health Service. RESULTS: When compared with other 
      chemotherapeutic agents, docetaxel has been shown to increase response rate, time 
      to progression and survival in patients with advanced breast cancer. In the 
      base-case analysis, the incremental cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus 
      paclitaxel was pound1995 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (1998 
      values). The incremental cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus vinorelbine was 
      pound14 055 per QALY gained. In the comparison with vinorelbine, docetaxel 
      provided the equivalent of an additional 92 days of perfect health. Sensitivity 
      analyses confirmed the robustness of the model and the validity of the base-case 
      analysis results. Even in the worst case scenarios, docetaxel remained cost 
      effective compared with paclitaxel and vinorelbine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      support the use of the taxoids, notably docetaxel, in the management of advanced 
      breast cancer.

TI  - The taxanes: toxicity and quality of life considerations in advanced ovarian 
      cancer.
PG  - S16-22
AB  - The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel show good activity in the management of 
      advanced ovarian cancer when used in conjunction with platinum agents. 
      Accumulating evidence from clinical studies, particularly the latest results from 
      the phase III comparative SCOTROC study, indicates that the two drugs confer 
      similar rates of tumour response and survival in women with this condition. 
      However, it is clear that paclitaxel and docetaxel differ in their tolerability 
      profiles and in other respects, and cannot be regarded as directly equivalent 
      drugs. In particular, paclitaxel is associated with significant neurotoxicity; 
      peripheral neuropathy has also been reported with docetaxel, but to a lesser 
      extent. Neutropenia appears more prevalent with docetaxel than with paclitaxel, 
      although clinical trial data show that this adverse effect is manageable and need 
      not compromise dose delivery. Docetaxel is also associated with potential 
      benefits accruing from shorter infusion times and lack of need for premedication 
      with intravenous histamine H(1) and H(2) antagonists. Emerging quality of life 
      data are expected to shed further light on the overall benefit of chemotherapy in 
      women with advanced ovarian cancer in general, and on taxane-platinum 
      combinations in particular.

TI  - Early clinical studies with docetaxel. Docetaxel Investigators Group.
PG  - S7-10
AB  - Docetaxel has been evaluated in six phase I studies involving a total of 234 
      patients with a wide variety of tumour types (50% had breast or ovarian cancer). 
      The aims of these studies were to determine the optimal dosage schedule of 
      docetaxel for use in subsequent phase II studies, and to characterise the 
      pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles of docetaxel. Intravenous (i.v.) doses 
      of docetaxel (5-115 mg/m2) were administered in various treatment schedules for a 
      total of 790 courses. Cycles were repeated every 2-3 weeks. Dose-dependent 
      neutropenia was the major dose-limiting adverse effect of docetaxel. Other 
      adverse events reported included hypersensitivity, fluid retention, skin 
      reactions, asthenia and alopecia. Anaphylactoid reactions occurred rarely. No 
      abnormal cardiac activity was detected, and neurological adverse events were 
      mild. Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 administered as a 1 h i.v. infusion every 3 weeks 
      combined acceptable tolerability with complete neutropenic recovery. This dosage 
      schedule was thus considered to be optimal for further investigation in phase II 
      studies.

      cardiotoxicity.
PG  - 205-13
LID - 10.2217/pgs.12.205 [doi]
AB  - Damage to the heart can result from both traditional chemotherapeutic agents, 
      such as doxorubicin, and newer 'targeted' therapies, such as trastuzumab. This 
      chemotherapeutic cardiotoxicity is potentially life-threatening and necessitates 
      limiting or discontinuing an otherwise-effective cancer treatment. Clinical 
      strategies focus on surveillance rather than prevention, although there are no 
      specific therapies for this highly morbid adverse effect. Current models for 
      prospectively predicting risk of chemotherapeutic cardiotoxicity are limited. 
      Cardiotoxicity can occur idiosyncratically in patients without obvious 
      demographic risk factors, suggesting a genetically determined susceptibility, and 
      candidate-gene studies have identified a limited number of variants that increase 
      risk. In this commentary we indicate a need for more powerful means to identify 
      risk prospectively, and suggest that broad pharmacogenomic approaches may be 
      fruitful.

TI  - Neratinib in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients.
PG  - 612-620
LID - 10.1177/1060028018824088 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
      efficacy of neratinib in human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)+ breast 
      cancer (BC). DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was performed using the term neratinib 
      between September 12, 2018, and November 21, 2018. References of published 
      articles and reviews were also assessed for additional information. STUDY 
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language preclinical and clinical studies 
      on the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of 
      neratinib were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Neratinib, an irreversible inhibitor of 
      HER1, HER2, and HER4, is Food and Drug Administration approved for the extended 
      adjuvant treatment of stage I-III HER2+ BC to follow trastuzumab-based therapy. A 
      phase III study has demonstrated statistically significant improvement in 5-year 
      disease-free survival rate (90.2 vs 87.7; hazard ratio = 0.73, 95% CI = 
      0.57-0.92, P = 0.0083). Its most common adverse effect is diarrhea, observed in 
      more than 90% of patients. The incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea (~40%) is reduced 
      by half with loperamide prophylaxis, which is recommended for the first 8 weeks 
      of neratinib therapy. Other common adverse reactions are nausea and fatigue. The 
      patients need to be monitored for liver function tests and drug interactions with 
      acid-reducing agents, CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, and P-glycoprotein substrates 
      with narrow therapeutic window. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: 
      American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
      clinical guidelines suggest the use of neratinib for extended adjuvant therapy 
      following 1-year trastuzumab in stage I to III HER2+ BC. Diarrhea remains a 
      clinically significant but manageable adverse event. CONCLUSION: Neratinib 
      significantly improves treatment outcomes and has manageable toxicity in stage I 
      to III HER2+ BC patients.

PG  - 197-203
LID - 10.4065/83.2.197 [doi]
AB  - Trastuzumab, a drug targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, improves 
      survival rate in women with metastatic breast cancer. Symptomatic heart failure, 
      a serious adverse effect of trastuzumab, occurs in 1% to 4% of patients treated 
      with the antibody, whereas left ventricular ejection fraction declines 
      substantially in 10% of patients. The prevalence of cardiotoxic effects of 
      trastuzumab appears to increase with exposure to anthracyclines. Serial 
      assessment of left ventricular function with 2-dimensional echocardiography or 
      radionuclide ventriculography is the most practical means of monitoring 
      cardiotoxicity. Patients who develop cardiotoxicity while receiving trastuzumab 
      therapy generally improve once use of the agent is discontinued.

TI  - Elucidation of optimal proteinuria management based on the risk of 
      ramucirumab-induced proteinuria.
PG  - 45

AB  - Proteinuria is a dose-limiting adverse effect of ramucirumab treatment, which is 
      an anti-angiogenic agent that targets the human vascular endothelial growth 
      factor. The predictors of proteinuria have not been completely elucidated and 
      there is currently no consensus. The present study aimed to identify the risk 
      factors for ramucirumab-induced proteinuria and to determine an optimal 
      proteinuria management. A total of 145 patients who received ramucirumab at Ogaki 
      Municipal Hospital (Ogaki, Japan) between September 2015 and March 2021 were 
      retrospectively studied. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted 
      to evaluate the association between the patient baseline characteristics and the 
      development of proteinuria following ramucirumab treatment. Furthermore, the time 
      of proteinuria onset and of the worst qualitative proteinuria were recorded. 
      Proteinuria (>2+) following ramucirumab was independently associated with lung 
      cancer [odd ratio (OR): 0.232, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.061-0.874; 
      P=0.031] and proteinuria at the start of treatment [qualitative test (+/-); OR: 
      4.760, 95% CI: 1.360-16.700; P=0.041]. The median time of onset of proteinuria 
      was 56 days (time range, 7-414 days), and the median time when the worst 
      qualitative results were observed was 83 days (time range, 7-442 days). The >2+ 
      proteinuria in the qualitative test was observed in 27 out of the 82 patients 
      with gastric cancer (P=0.041), 8/21 patients with colon cancer (P=0.188), and in 
      3 out of the 37 patients with lung cancer (P=0.003). The prevalence of 
      proteinuria was low in patients with lung cancer, and proteinuria (>2+) was 
      likely to occur when the proteinuria at the start of ramucirumab was (+/-) by 
      qualitative test. The results from the present study indicated that particular 
      attention should be paid to proteinuria at the start of treatment when monitoring 
      proteinuria as an adverse event of ramucirumab treatment.

TI  - Enzalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer: results and implications of 
      the AFFIRM trial.
PG  - 351-62
LID - 10.2217/fon.13.275 [doi]
AB  - Enzalutamide is a second-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor that 
      was approved by the US FDA in 2012 for the treatment of metastatic 
      docetaxel-pretreated castrate-resistant prostate cancer. In preclinical studies, 
      enzalutamide demonstrated higher affinity to the androgen receptor compared with 
      the first-generation androgen receptor inhibitors. In the well-designed Phase III 
      AFFIRM study, enzalutamide treatment showed improved overall survival compared 
      with placebo in addition to improvement of all preplanned secondary parameters. 
      Overall, enzalutamide seemed to be very well tolerated with a favorable 
      side-effect profile, with a lower incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events. A 
      potentially concerning adverse effect was the occurrence of seizures that were 
      reported in approximately 1% of the patients receiving enzalutamide (compared 
      with 0% in the placebo arm). This review will summarize the mechanism of action 
      of enzalutamide, the preclinical and clinical development that led to its 
      approval focusing on the AFFIRM trial results, its safety and efficacy and the 
      ongoing trials, as well as patterns of resistance to this drug in the context of 
      five new drugs approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer. With a changing landscape for these patients, treatment 
      sequencing and best treatment for individual patients remains challenging.

TI  - Monitoring the introduction of new drugs--Herceptin to cardiotoxicity.
PG  - 478-81
AB  - Trastuzumab (Herceptin), currently prescribed for metastatic breast cancer, has 
      recently been shown to be effective as adjuvant therapy in early receptor 2 
      (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Cardiotoxicity is a serious adverse effect. A 
      decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) occurs in as many as 27% of 
      women treated with trastuzumab when combined with standard chemotherapy. The 
      pathophysiology of this effect, which differs from the cardiotoxicity of 
      anthracyclines, remains poorly understood. While overt heart failure is reversed 
      with standard therapy, the longer-term consequences of asymptomatic declines in 
      LVEF remain unknown. Monitoring 3-monthly for 5-10% changes in LVEF, the criteria 
      for cessation of trastuzumab therapy in the clinical trials, is not possible for 
      the population of women who might benefit from trastuzumab for early breast 
      cancer. Extension of this therapy to an older and less fit population than those 
      enrolled in the trials, with less rigorous cardiac screening, may result in 
      significantly more cardiotoxicity.

TI  - Pleurodesis and Immunotherapy in NSCLC; Medical Thoracoscopy or VATS?
PG  - 1606-1613
LID - 10.7150/jca.40004 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Immunotherapy is a treatment option for non-small cell lung cancer 
      advanced disease. However; immunotherapy in several patients induces orogonitis 
      and effusion in different cavities. It is up to the treating physician to 
      understand whether there is effusion due to adverse effect or disease 
      progression. Pleurodesis in both cases might be a solution for recurrent pleura 
      effusion. Patients and Methods: Three hundred and thirty seven non-small cell 
      lung cancer patients with adenocarcinoma and pleura effusion during first line 
      immunotherapy treatment underwent medical thoracoscopy or Video assisted thoracic 
      surgery (VATS) for pleurodesis with talk poudrage. Uniportal medical thoracoscopy 
      was performed under general with dual channel endotracheal tube in one hundred 
      and eleven patients. Video assisted thoracic surgery was performed in one hundred 
      and eighty seven patients and conversion from medical to VATS procedure was done 
      to thirty nine patients. All patients had stage IV disease with pleura 
      involvement and were under first line pembrolizumab treatment with 200mg (PD-L1 ≥ 
      50%). Results: The quantitative parameters of the study (expression, PY and 
      cycle) were converted to an ordinal scale to facilitate the performance of 
      statistical analysis. All parameters were examined as dependent against the 
      parameter technique acting as independent to detect potential relationships. The 
      results of multi Y versus X relationship revealed no statistically significant 
      effect (p>0.05) of the three levels of technique against any response considered. 
      Thus we can infer, quite safely, that the innovative operation (level 0) does not 
      differ from the other two conventional methods (levels 2 and 3) through all 
      parameters entered in the model. There was no significant difference between the 
      different pleurodesis techniques. Discussion: Immunotherapy is known to induce in 
      a number of patients pleura effusion and pericarditis. However; pleurodesis is 
      efficient when the appropriate method is performed to every patient. Careful 
      assessment in a case by case manner has to be performed for each patient before 
      any procedure is performed.

TI  - Chrysin Increases the Therapeutic Efficacy of Docetaxel and Mitigates 
      Docetaxel-Induced Edema.
PG  - 496-504
LID - 10.1177/1534735416645184 [doi]
AB  - Docetaxel (DTX) is an effective commercial anticancer agent for chemotherapy in 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate 
      cancer, but its adverse effects including edema, neurotoxicity, and hair loss 
      limit its application. To improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy of DTX and reduce 
      adverse effects, combination therapy is one of the alternative methods. So 
      chrysin, which has various biological activities including anticancer effects, 
      was considered. In vitro, the combination of chrysin and DTX was investigated in 
      A549 cells. Increased cytotoxicity, suppressed cellular proliferation, and 
      induced apoptosis were observed with posttreatment of chrysin following DTX 
      treatment. In vivo, chrysin enhanced the tumor growth delay of DTX and increased 
      DTX-induced apoptosis in the A549-derived xenograft model. Furthermore, chrysin 
      prevented DTX-induced edema in ICR mouse. These results indicated that chrysin 
      strengthened the therapeutic efficacy of DTX and diminished the adverse effect of 
      DTX, suggesting chrysin could be exploited as an adjuvant therapy for NSCLC.

LID - 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000051 [doi]
AB  - Sensory neuropathy is the dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel and also impacts 
      on the use of docetaxel and other taxanes. The cause of this adverse effect has 
      to do with their mechanism of action against microtubules and its interaction 
      with neuronal cytoskeletal components. The variability of this toxicity is 
      defined by several factors including disease type, taxane class, schedule and 
      dose of the specific drug, patient demographics, and use of taxanes in 
      combination regimens (especially with the platinums that are also neurotoxic). 
      Prevention of life-long neuropathy is only produced if the causative drug is 
      halted--treatments to reverse toxicity have shown only minimal improvement. This 
      review investigates trials defining the clinical factors that determine the 
      therapeutic window of taxanes and the enhanced susceptibility to this toxicity. 
      In addition, case vignettes illustrate the range of clinical manifestations of 
      this toxicity during taxane administration.

TI  - ARETTA: Assessing Response to Neoadjuvant Taxotere and Subcutaneous Trastuzumab 
      in Nigerian Women With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: A Study Protocol.
PG  - 983-990
LID - 10.1200/GO.20.00043 [doi]
LID - GO.20.00043
AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) subtype of breast cancer is 
      aggressive, leading to a poor outcome. Targeted therapy with trastuzumab has been 
      shown to be effective in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. 
      Cardiotoxicity is a specific adverse effect associated with trastuzumab. The 
      initial formulation of trastuzumab was intravenous, but presently, a subcutaneous 
      formulation (Herceptin SC) is available. Insufficient data on the response rate 
      and cardiotoxic effects of trastuzumab among indigenous Black populations exist. 
      In all studies evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab alone or in 
      combination with chemotherapy, indigenous Black populations in Africa were not 
      included, yet they are the ones most likely to benefit from highly effective 
      cancer medicines. This is partly due to poor oncology clinical trial 
      infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa. The ARETTA study protocol 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03879577) is a phase II multicenter 
      feasibility study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel given every 
      3 weeks for 4 cycles plus trastuzumab in 60 previously untreated women with 
      nonmetastatic breast cancer. The primary endpoint is to assess the proportion of 
      patients with complete pathologic response. Secondary endpoints include the 
      number of patients who require dose delays in docetaxel and trastuzumab 
      attributed to hematologic, GI, and cardiac toxicity. Pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      subcutaneous trastuzumab will also be determined. The ARETTA study will provide 
      important information on the clinical response and cardiac safety of subcutaneous 
      trastuzumab in combination with docetaxel among indigenous African women with 
      nonmetastatic breast cancer. It can also be used as a blueprint for conducting 
      biomarker-driven oncology clinical trials in low-resource settings such as 
      sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Peripheral neuropathy induced by microtubule-stabilizing agents.
PG  - 1633-42
AB  - Microtubule-stabilizing agents (MTSAs), including the taxanes and epothilones, 
      are effective chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many cancers. 
      Neuropathy is a major adverse effect of MTSA-based chemotherapy, with severe 
      peripheral neuropathy (grade 3 or 4) occurring in as many as 30% of patients 
      treated with a MTSA. MTSA-induced neuropathy usually resolves gradually after 
      cessation of the treatment. The most reliable method to accurately assess 
      MTSA-induced neuropathy is by clinical evaluation, although additional techniques 
      are being developed and evaluated. Among MTSA-induced neuropathy, the most 
      extensively studied is that induced by taxanes; such a neuropathy usually 
      presents as sensory neuropathy and is more common with paclitaxel than docetaxel. 
      The incidence of MTSA-induced neuropathy seems to depend on the MTSA dose per 
      treatment cycle, the schedule of treatment, and the duration of the infusion. 
      Although there have been several small clinical trials with neuroprotective 
      agents, early recognition and supportive care are the best approaches for 
      prevention and management of MTSA-induced neuropathy. In the future, research 
      should focus on elucidating the mechanism of MTSA-induced neuropathy, developing 
      reliable in vivo and in vitro preclinical models to study MTSA-induced 
      neuropathy, developing a more reliable grading system for MTSA-induced 
      neuropathy, developing more reliable methods for evaluating MTSA-induced 
      neuropathy, and evaluating the efficacy of potential neuroprotective agents in 
      clinical trials.

      A Review of the Literature.
PG  - 133-140
LID - 10.1177/0897190019850929 [doi]
AB  - Two Food and Drug Administration-approved programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) 
      inhibitors, nivolumab (Opdivo®), and pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), are indicated for 
      treatment-resistant malignancies. Inhibition of PD-1 also inhibits T-cell 
      peripheral tolerance, enhancing autoimmunity. Various autoimmune conditions have 
      been reported with the use of these agents, including type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      (T1DM). This article reviews literature regarding the development of T1DM in 
      patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors and identifies strategies for the 
      appropriate identification, monitoring, and follow-up of these patients. 
      Published cases of T1DM related to PD-1 inhibitor therapy were identified using 
      PubMed. Eighty-three identified publications were reviewed, of which 37 
      publications involving 42 cases of anti-PD-1 therapy-induced T1DM were 
      identified. The average age of patients at presentation was 62 years and 59.5% 
      were male. The mean number of PD-1 inhibitor doses received was 5, with a mean 
      time to presentation of 11 weeks. Initial presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis 
      was reported in 69% of cases, with an average blood glucose of 660 mg/dL and an 
      average HbA(1c) of 8.7%. The exact mechanism PD-1 inhibitor therapy-induced T1DM 
      is unknown. Blood glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients receiving 
      anti-PD-1 therapy. Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this 
      adverse effect, as well as to evaluate potential risk factors and ideal 
      management strategies.

TI  - Docetaxel-associated myalgia-arthralgia syndrome in patients with breast cancer.
PG  - 39-44
LID - 10.2147/BCTT.S124646 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As taxanes are increasingly used in oncology, the myalgia-arthralgia 
      syndrome (M-AS) that represents an adverse effect of these drugs is becoming more 
      common. Nevertheless, information regarding predisposing factors, prevention, and 
      therapy of the syndrome is still lacking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women who had 
      received docetaxel as part of the FEC-D(T) regimen for the adjuvant treatment of 
      breast cancer were retrospectively identified from the records of our oncology 
      department. Data on demographics, disease specifics, adverse effects, and 
      treatment were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who 
      developed M-AS after docetaxel treatment and those who did not develop the 
      syndrome. The two groups were compared to identify risk factors for M-AS. 
      Effectiveness of drugs used for M-AS was evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients 
      were identified as fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Nineteen patients developed 
      the M-AS after the first docetaxel administration. Forty-eight patients did not 
      develop the syndrome. Three patients in this group were excluded because they had 
      been taking gabapentin or pregabalin at the time of docetaxel administration for 
      another indication. The remaining 45 patients constituted the control group. The 
      two groups were similar in age, menopause status, stage of their cancer, and 
      histology. The M-AS group had a higher median body surface area and was more 
      likely to receive less than the three intended cycles of docetaxel. Nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, atypical antiepileptics, extended corticosteroids, and 
      opioids were drugs used as M-AS treatments. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel-associated M-AS 
      is an adverse effect causing incomplete drug treatment. Possible risk factors and 
      effectiveness of treatments for the syndrome are presented.

TI  - Dexamethasone premedication for prophylaxis of taxane toxicities: can the doses 
      be reduced when paclitaxel or docetaxel are given weekly?
PG  - 250-6
LID - 10.1177/1078155211409473 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical literature supporting reduced doses of 
      dexamethasone to prevent taxane hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and edema/skin 
      toxicities in respect to docetaxel, when taxanes are given weekly, as opposed to 
      every 3 weeks. DATA SOURCE: Clinical literature of human-controlled clinical 
      trials, accessed through MEDLINE and meeting abstract databases (from 1990 to 
      2010). DATA EXTRACTION: The retrieved literature was reviewed to include all 
      human clinical trials that recorded adverse effect information with weekly 
      taxanes utilizing reduced-dose or tapering dexamethasone schemas, either 
      prospectively or retrospectively. DATA SYNTHESIS: Prophylaxis for 
      paclitaxel-related HSRs generally includes one or more 20 mg doses of 
      dexamethasone, with histamine-1 and -2 receptor antagonists prior to infusion of 
      paclitaxel. Prophylaxis for docetaxel-related HSRs generally includes 
      dexamethasone beginning 1 day before docetaxel, and continuing twice daily for a 
      total of 3 days. These schedules were designed for taxanes given every 3 weeks, 
      but may lead to steroid-related adverse effects when given weekly with weekly 
      taxane administration. Treatment strategies designed to reduce corticosteroid 
      exposure in patients receiving weekly taxanes have been investigated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Several predication strategies utilizing reduced doses of 
      dexamethasone with weekly taxanes appear to be feasible and safe, and can be 
      considered for patients experiencing, or at high risk for steroid-induced side 
      effects. However, the optimal schedule is not yet determined; larger prospective 
      clinical trials are needed.

TI  - Essential roles of Her2/erbB2 in cardiac development and function.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - The tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2, also known in humans as Her2, is a member of 
      the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or erbB1) family, which also includes 
      erbB3 and erbB4. The erbBs were discovered in an avian erythroblastosis tumor 
      virus and exhibited similarities to human EGFR (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001). 
      Her2/erbB2 is highly expressed in many cancer types. Its overexpression is 
      correlated with a poor prognosis for breast and ovarian cancer patients. ErbB 
      receptors bind to a family of growth factors, termed neuregulins/heregulin 
      (NRG/HRG), which comprise NRG-1, -2, -3, and -4 and include multiple isoforms. 
      ErbB2/Her2 is an orphan receptor that does not bind ligand alone but 
      heterodimerizes with the other erbB receptors for NRG signaling. ErbB2 is 
      expressed in multiple neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in embryos and adult 
      animals, including the heart. Genetic data demonstrated that erbB2 is required 
      for normal embryonic development of neural crest-derived cranial sensory neurons. 
      ErbB2/Her2-null mutant embryos of a trabeculation defect die before embryonic day 
      (E) 11. To study its role at later stages of development, we generated a 
      transgenic mouse line that specifically expresses the rat erbB2 cDNA in the heart 
      under the control of the cardiac-specific alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. When 
      crossed into the null background, the expression of the rat erbB2 cDNA rescued 
      the cardiac phenotype in the erbB2-null mutant mice that survive until birth but 
      display an absence of Schwann cells and a severe loss of both motor and spinal 
      sensory neurons. To study the role of erbB2 in the adult heart, we generated 
      conditional mutant mice carrying a cardiac-restricted deletion of erbB2. These 
      erbB2 conditional mutants exhibited multiple independent parameters of dilated 
      cardiomyopathy, including chamber dilation, wall thinning, and decreased 
      contractility. Interestingly, treatment of breast cancers overexpressing erbB2 
      with Herceptin (Trastuzumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody specific to the 
      extracellular domain of erbB2, results in some patients developing cardiac 
      dysfunction. The adverse effect is increased significantly in those patients who 
      also receive the chemotherapeutical agent anthracycline. We found that 
      erbB2-deficient cardiac myocytes are more susceptible to anthracycline-induced 
      cytotoxicity. These results suggest that erbB2 signaling in the heart is 
      essential for the prevention of dilated cardiomyopathy. These lines of mice 
      provide models with which to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by 
      which erbB2 signaling regulates cardiac functions. These mice also will provide 
      important information for devising strategies to mitigate the cardiotoxic effects 
      of Herceptin treatment, allowing for the potential expanded use of this drug to 
      treat all cancers overexpressing erbB2.

LID - 10.1007/s11912-022-01234-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes current HER2-targeted therapies and 
      clinical studies that have investigated primary and secondary prevention of 
      cardiac dysfunction for HER2 + breast cancer patients undergoing targeted 
      therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Primary and secondary prevention clinical trials 
      highlight the importance of cardioprotective measures during HER2 + cancer 
      treatment. Together, these studies suggest the safety of neurohormonal drugs, the 
      importance for an individualized approach in starting cardiopreventive therapies, 
      and the potential to expand HER2 + treatment options to patients with cardiac 
      dysfunction. Cardiac dysfunction is a concerning adverse effect for HER2-targeted 
      treatment. The goal of primary and secondary prevention is to prevent (further) 
      cardiac function decline and heart failure symptoms, while delivering appropriate 
      cancer therapy. Clinical trials investigating preventative therapies in the 
      context of primary and secondary prevention are paving the path for reducing 
      adverse cardiac effects and expanding treatment options for patients previously 
      unable to undergo HER + therapy.

TI  - Future perspectives of docetaxel (Taxotere) in front-line therapy.
PG  - S10-27-S10-33
AB  - The recognition that early breast cancer is a systemic disease has led to the 
      development of multimodal treatments incorporating adjuvant hormonal and 
      chemotherapies. Adjuvant strategies have improved the outcome of treatment for 
      early breast cancer, but 50% of women still relapse and develop overt metastatic 
      disease, which is largely incurable. In the search for more effective 
      chemotherapies, the taxoid, docetaxel (Taxotere; Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, 
      France), has demonstrated high single-agent activity against metastatic breast 
      cancer, including visceral metastases, and is now in phase III trials of 
      combination adjuvant and front-line therapies. When cytotoxic drugs are used in 
      combination, it is important to consider the dose-response relationships and the 
      toxicity profiles of the agents involved. It often is necessary to reduce the 
      doses of drugs given in combination to avoid excessive toxicity; this may result 
      in the administration of suboptimal doses. Early clinical studies have shown that 
      therapeutic doses of docetaxel (60 to 100 mg/m2) can be used in combinations with 
      doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, vinorelbine, and 
      cisplatin. The most frequent adverse effect of docetaxel is neutropenia (91% of 
      patients), but other effects, such as neurosensory changes and fluid retention, 
      also must be taken into consideration when planning combination therapies. It may 
      be possible to ameliorate some toxicities by preventive measures. Fluid 
      retention, which generally occurs at cumulative doses greater than 500 mg/m2, has 
      been shown to be reduced in severity and delayed in onset by prophylactic 
      corticosteroid treatment from the day before each docetaxel administration for 3 
      to 5 days. Neutropenia may be reduced by treatment with granulocyte 
      colony-stimulating factor, and neurotoxicity may be reduced by protectants such 
      as amifostine. These strategies are under investigation. The high single-agent 
      activity of docetaxel makes it an excellent candidate for treatments such as 
      induction regimens before high-dose chemotherapy and adjuvant therapies. 
      Short-term treatment regimens such as these should also avoid the cumulative 
      toxicities of docetaxel. It is important that new drugs, such as docetaxel, which 
      have shown promising activity against metastatic disease and could have a 
      significant impact on the natural history of early breast cancer, are 
      investigated as front-line treatments.

AB  - The war against cancer has seen a proliferation in armamentarium over the last 
      decades. A new antineoplastic agent, trastuzumab, was synthesized in 1991 and 
      gained United States Food and Drug Administration approval in 1998 for treatment 
      of metastatic breast cancer. Cardiotoxicity manifesting as dilated cardiomyopathy 
      is a rarely reported adverse effect of trastuzumab. We hereby report a case of 
      dilated cardiomyopathy, which occurred following trastuzumab chemotherapy in a 
      32-year-old female. The patient responded to discontinuation of trastuzumab and 
      standard medical treatment. Extensive search of Indian literature revealed no 
      reported case of dilated cardiomyopathy occurring due to trastuzumab.

      review of its safety, efficacy, and place in therapy.
PG  - 51-70
LID - 10.2147/CE.S217848 [doi]
AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is a 
      distinct subset of breast cancer that results from overexpression of HER2 
      protein. Pertuzumab-a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the 
      extracellular dimerization domain II of HER2-was recently approved for adjuvant 
      therapy and neoadjuvant therapy of HER2-positive early breast cancer. As 
      pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to different domains of the extracellular 
      dimerization domain of HER2, a combination therapy of pertuzumab and trastuzumab 
      is beneficial for the treatment of metastatic cancer, advanced local cancer, or 
      early cancer by dual HER2 blockage. Many clinical trials have been performed 
      using pertuzumab for breast cancer patients; these include the CLEOPATRA trial 
      for palliative therapy, the APHINITY trial for adjuvant therapy, and the 
      NeoSphere and the TRYPHAENA trials for neoadjuvant therapy. These trials revealed 
      pertuzumab to be a safe and effective drug regardless of the patient age and 
      hormone receptor status. Notably, pertuzumab use was associated with severe 
      cardiac toxicity in some cases; however, the risk of pertuzumab-induced cardiac 
      dysfunction was low. The most common adverse effect associated with 
      pertuzumab-use was diarrhea, but most cases were not severe. Several different 
      chemotherapeutic agents have been investigated to determine optimal 
      chemotherapeutic combinations for dual HER2 blockage. Some exploratory analyses 
      indicate that pertuzumab treatment offered little benefit to patients with 
      node-negative and small primary tumors; pertuzumab treatment was also found not 
      be cost-effective. Further research will reveal the appropriate usage of 
      pertuzumab for treating a subset of eligible patients.

TI  - Pretreatment with different doses of dexamethasone in the prevention of 
      docetaxel-induced hypersensitivity.
PG  - 61-65
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone 
      pretreatment regimen with different doses in the prevention of docetaxel-induced 
      hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). One hundred and sixty-two patients who had 
      malignant tumors as determined by histology and/or cytology and received 
      docetaxel treatments at least 2 cycles, were randomized into two groups. There 
      were 90 patients in the study group and 72 patients in the control group. In the 
      study group, patients received 4.5mg of oral dexamethasone once a day. Patients 
      in the control group received 8 mg of dexamethasone twice a day. All patients 
      received dexamethasone for 3 days, from the day before docetaxel treatment to the 
      day after docetaxel treatment. The endpoints were hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) 
      and other adverse effects, which were determined according to common terminology 
      criteria for adverse event v3.0 (CTCAE 3.0). In the study group, 10 patients had 
      HSRs (11.1%). While in the control group, 7 patients had HSRs (9.7%), and the 
      main clinical symptoms of HSR were rash (3.1%), fever/chill (2.5%), angioedema 
      (1.9%), chest discomfort (1.9%) and hypotension (0.6%). There was no 
      statistically significant difference between these two groups (P=0.774). There 
      was no significant difference in the incidence rate of adverse effect between 
      patients in the study group and in the control group. Those adverse effects 
      included neutropenia, decreased hemoglobin, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and fluid 
      retention. Since no significant difference in the HSR incidence between these two 
      groups has been found, 4.5mg of dexamethasone (qd) is as efficient and safe as 
      8mg (bid).

      Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma.
PG  - 64-71
LID - 10.1200/OP.20.00771 [doi]
AB  - The checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab are principal treatment 
      options for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma. In patients who 
      decline autologous stem-cell transplantation or who are unsuited for high-dose 
      chemotherapy and subsequent autologous stem-cell transplantation because of 
      comorbidities, the use of checkpoint inhibitors may improve overall survival and 
      have a manageable side effect profile. This clinical review provides an 
      evidence-based summary to guide practicing oncologists in the use of checkpoint 
      inhibitors in relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma and includes 
      checkpoint inhibitor efficacy and adverse effect profiles. We highlight the use 
      of checkpoint inhibitors in the management of relapsed or refractory classic 
      Hodgkin lymphoma in patients who are ineligible for an autologous stem-cell 
      transplant with the goal of improving disease control while limiting adverse 
      events.

TI  - Real Life Study of Lenvatinib Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: RELEVANT 
      Study.
PG  - 527-539
LID - 10.1159/000525145 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the REFLECT trial, lenvatinib was found to be noninferior 
      compared to sorafenib in terms of overall survival. Here, we analyze the effects 
      of lenvatinib in the real-life experience of several centers across the world and 
      identify clinical factors that could be significantly associated with survival 
      outcomes. METHODS: The study population was derived from retrospectively 
      collected data of HCC patients treated with lenvatinib. The overall cohort 
      included western and eastern populations from 23 center in five countries. 
      RESULTS: We included 1,325 patients with HCC and treated with lenvatinib in our 
      analysis. Median OS was 16.1 months. Overall response rate was 38.5%. 
      Multivariate analysis for OS highlighted that HBsAg positive, NLR >3, and AST >38 
      were independently associated with poor prognosis in all models. Conversely, 
      NAFLD/NASH-related etiology was independently associated with good prognosis. 
      Median progression-free survival was 6.3 months. Multivariate analysis for 
      progression-free survival revealed that NAFLD/NASH, BCLC, NLR, and AST were 
      independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival. A proportion of 
      75.2% of patients suffered from at least one adverse effect during the study 
      period. Multivariate analysis exhibited the appearance of decreased appetite 
      grade ≥2 versus grade 0-1 as an independent prognostic factor for worse 
      progression-free survival. 924 patients of 1,325 progressed during lenvatinib 
      (69.7%), and 827 of them had a follow-up over 2 months from the beginning of 
      second-line treatment. From first-line therapy, the longest median OS was 
      obtained with the sequence lenvatinib and immunotherapy (47.0 months), followed 
      by TACE (24.7 months), ramucirumab (21.2 months), sorafenib (15.7 months), 
      regorafenib (12.7 months), and best supportive care (10.8 months). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study confirms in a large and global population of patients with advanced 
      HCC, not candidates for locoregional treatment the OS reported in the 
      registration study and a high response rate with lenvatinib.

TI  - Docetaxel/irinotecan combination chemotherapy in platinum/taxane-refractory and 
      -resistant ovarian cancer: JGOG/WJGOG Intergroup Study.
PG  - 126-31
LID - 10.1007/s10147-011-0353-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and 
      toxicity of docetaxel and irinotecan combination chemotherapy in patients with 
      ovarian cancer refractory and resistant to both platinum and taxan treatment. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who had been treated with platinum and paclitaxel 
      but whose ovarian cancer progressed or recurred within 6 months of treatment (n = 
      41) received docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) (day 1) and irinotecan 60 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8), 
      repeated every 21 days [Japan Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG) study 3015] or 
      every 28 days [West Japan Gynecologic Oncology Group (WJGOG) study 002] until 
      disease progression was observed or unacceptable toxicity. Sixteen patients had 
      platinum/paclitaxel-refractory disease, and 25 patients had 
      platinum/paclitaxel-resistant disease. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were 
      available for determination of the clinical response. The overall response rate 
      [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] was 6.3%, and the disease 
      control rate (CR + PR + stable disease) was 34.4%. Among the 23 patients with 
      resistant tumor, the disease control rate was 47.8%. Ten patients with refractory 
      tumor showed a 10% disease control rate. The median progression-free interval was 
      12.1 weeks and the median overall survival time was 45.3 weeks. The major toxic 
      adverse effect was neutropenia (grade 4, 56.1%), but the incidence of neutropenic 
      fever was less frequent (4.9%). Neurotoxicity and gastro-intestinal toxicity were 
      mild. CONCLUSION: Among our patients, a combination of docetaxel and irinotecan 
      was well tolerated. However, this combination may not be a beneficial option for 
      patients with platinum-refractory and -resistant ovarian cancer in terms of 
      response rate and survival.

TI  - Combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel: a regimen overestimated in refractory 
      metastatic osteosarcoma?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel (GT) has been 
      demonstrated to be effective against various types of solid tumors, including 
      sarcoma. However, the regimen has not been confirmed in large, well-designed 
      clinical trials in refractory metastatic osteosarcoma. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with refractory metastatic 
      osteosarcoma at Peking University People's Hospital who were treated with 
      gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) intravenously (IV) on Day 1 and Day 8, and docetaxel 
      (75 mg/m(2)) IV on Day 8, repeated every 21 days. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients 
      with a median age of 18.4 years were treated with GT at the Peking University 
      People's Hospital from August 2012 to August 2017. A total of 174 courses were 
      administered. Only five patients with pulmonary metastasis achieved a best 
      response of stable disease (SD), while all other patients had progressive 
      disease. The result was disappointing with an ORR of 0%, a DCR of 9.6%, and a 
      median DOR of 3.5 months. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in 69 (39.7%) 
      courses and in 28 (53.8%) patients, most of which were myelosuppression, 
      especially thrombocytopenia. No fatal adverse effect (AE) was found. CONCLUSION: 
      The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel (GT) as a salvage regimen is 
      well-tolerated but not as effective as expected in refractory metastatic 
      osteosarcoma. This report highlights the need for the development of new 
      approaches with higher activity in these patients.

TI  - Heart Failure Therapies for the Prevention of HER2-Monoclonal Antibody-Mediated 
      Cardiotoxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13215527 [doi]
LID - 5527
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and antibody-drug 
      conjugates, form the backbone of HER2-positive breast cancer therapy. 
      Unfortunately, an important adverse effect of these agents is cardiotoxicity, 
      occurring in approximately 10% of patients. There is increasing published data 
      regarding prevention strategies for cardiotoxicity, though seldom used in 
      clinical practice. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      randomized-controlled trials to evaluate pharmacotherapy for the prevention of 
      monoclonal HER2-directed antibody-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with breast 
      cancer. Online databases were queried from their inception until October 2021. 
      Effects were determined by calculating risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (CI) or mean differences (MD) using random-effects models. We 
      identified five eligible trials. In the three trials (n = 952) reporting data on 
      the primary outcome of cardiotoxicity, there was no clear effect for patients 
      assigned active treatment compared to control (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.29, p 
      = 0.57). Effects were similar for ACE-I/ARB and beta-blockers (p homogeneity = 
      0.50). Active treatment reduced the risk of HER2 therapy interruptions (RR = 
      0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77, p < 0.001) with similar findings for ACE-I/ARB and 
      beta-blockers (p homogeneity = 0.97). Prophylactic treatment with ACE-I/ARB or 
      beta-blocker therapy may be of value for cardio-protection in patients with 
      breast cancer prescribed monoclonal antibodies. Further, adequately powered 
      randomized trials are required to define the role of routine prophylactic 
      treatment in this patient group.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of PD-1 and PD-L1 Inhibitors Monotherapy in 
      Metastatic Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 56-63
LID - 10.5005/jp-journals-10018-1321 [doi]
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors are new targeted treatments that harness the body's 
      immune system to attack cancers. Drugs that are most extensively used among 
      checkpoint inhibitors inhibit the PD-L1 or PD-1 (programmed death 1) ligand or 
      receptor pair and are currently approved for many cancer indications. In gastric 
      or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas one inhibitor, pembrolizumab has 
      regulatory approval for PD-L1 positive carcinomas. This meta-analysis 
      investigates available data on the efficacy of PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors as a 
      class in gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. The literature was 
      reviewed to identify clinical studies that included arms with PD-L1 or PD-1 
      inhibitors as monotherapy in gastric or gastroesophageal junction 
      adenocarcinomas. Relevant patient characteristics, outcomes, and adverse effects 
      were recorded. Summary estimates of response rates (RR) and survival were 
      calculated using a random or fixed effect model, depending on heterogeneity. Six 
      studies with a total of 1068 patients were included in the analysis. The summary 
      RR was 10.63% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.36-15.89%). The summary disease 
      control rate (DCR) was 28.11% (95% CI 24.60-31.63%). Summary progression-free 
      survival (PFS) was 1.59 months (95% CI 1.24-1.94 months). Summary overall 
      survival (OS) was 5.72 months (95% CI 0-12.19 months). A subset of patients 
      derived long-term benefits as seen in other cancer locations. The adverse effect 
      rate was low and consistent with that in other disease locations. Low efficacy of 
      immune checkpoint inhibitors as a class in gastric or gastroesophageal junction 
      adenocarcinomas is observed in this analysis and stresses the need for effective 
      biomarker use for the identification of most probable responders. How to cite

TI  - Dual HER2 Targeting with Trastuzumab and Liposomal-Encapsulated Doxorubicin 
      (MM-302) Demonstrates Synergistic Antitumor Activity in Breast and Gastric 
      Cancer.
PG  - 1517-27
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1518 [doi]
AB  - Trastuzumab is the standard of care for HER2-positive breast cancer patients, 
      markedly improving disease-free and overall survival. Combined with chemotherapy, 
      it enhances patient outcomes, but cardiotoxicity due to the trastuzumab treatment 
      poses a serious adverse effect. MM-302 is a HER2-targeted PEGylated liposome that 
      encapsulates doxorubicin to facilitate its delivery to HER2-overexpressing tumor 
      cells while limiting exposure to nontarget tissues, including the heart. In this 
      study, we evaluated the feasibility and preclinical activity of combining MM-302 
      with trastuzumab. MM-302 and trastuzumab target different domains of the HER2 
      receptor and thus could simultaneously bind HER2-overexpressing tumor cells in 
      vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, trastuzumab did not disrupt the mechanism of 
      action of MM-302 in delivering doxorubicin to the n0ucleus and inducing DNA 
      damage. Reciprocally, MM-302 did not interfere with the ability of trastuzumab to 
      block prosurvival p-Akt signaling. Interestingly, coadministration of the two 
      agents acutely increased the deposition of MM-302 in human xenograft tumors and 
      subsequently increased the expression of the DNA damage marker p-p53. Finally, 
      the combination of MM-302 and trastuzumab induced synergistic antitumor activity 
      in HER2-overexpressing xenograft models of breast and gastric cancer. 
      Collectively, our findings highlight a novel combination therapy that efficiently 
      targets HER2-overexpressing cells through multiple mechanisms and support the 
      ongoing investigation of combined MM-302/trastuzumab therapy for HER2-positive 
      metastatic breast cancer in a randomized phase II clinical trial.

AB  - In cancer patients, a cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a prevalent occurrence. 
      When a patient has both heart disease and cancer, the treatment can be 
      complicated because treatment for one condition can have an adverse effect on the 
      outcome of the other. A cardiovascular disease that involves heart failures, 
      coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, pericardial diseases, arrhythmias, and 
      valve and vascular dysfunction is a serious worry for long-term cancer patients. 
      Because preclinical research is limited, it is critical to comprehend the 
      pathophysiology of CVD as a consequence of anticancerous therapies while taking 
      into account the developing and expanding heart. As a result, in this research, 
      we look at the epidemiological characteristics of cancer patients who also have 
      cardiovascular illness. Low-dose chest computed tomography, cardiac CT, and 
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to acquire the data and perform 
      the screening. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines and trastuzumab are 
      used to treat the condition. Univariate analysis is used to examine risk factors 
      and predict cardiovascular damage. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
      value, negative predictive value, life expectancy, left ventricular ejection 
      fraction (LVEF), and longitudinal strain are among the metrics examined.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The utility of two-drug chemotherapy regimens in elderly or 
      performance status (PS 2) patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC) remains to be established. Preclinical studies suggested that celecoxib, 
      a Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, has antitumor activity in NSCLC and can enhance the 
      activity of chemotherapy drugs. We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the 
      efficacy of the combination of weekly docetaxel and celecoxib in advanced NSCLC 
      patients, who were either elderly (> or =70 years) or PS2. METHODS: Patients with 
      stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) or IV NSCLC who were > or =70 years and had a 
      PS of 0-2 or patients of any age with a PS of 2 were included. Patients should 
      have been off any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for 30 continuous days 
      before study enrollment. Patients were treated with weekly docetaxel 36 mg/m i.v. 
      on days 1, 8, 15 of a 28 day cycle and Celecoxib 400 mg po twice daily. Disease 
      assessment was performed after every two cycles. The study design required 39 
      patients. RESULTS: Study was terminated after 34 patients were enrolled due to 
      safety concerns regarding celecoxib. Thirty patients were evaluable. The response 
      rate was 15%. The median progression free survival and median survival were 2.3 
      months and 5.0 months, respectively. The median survival of patients > or =70 
      years old with a PS of 0-1 was 8.3 months and the median survival of PS2 patients 
      was 2.8 months. The combination was well tolerated with fatigue as the most 
      common adverse effect. Two patients developed arterial thrombotic events. 
      CONCLUSION: In these 'special populations' of patients with advanced NSCLC, the 
      addition of celecoxib to docetaxel did not seem to improve the outcome compared 
      with single agent docetaxel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunity plays a major role in carcinogenesis and this is the case 
      also for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Checkpoint inhibitors, novel drugs that 
      enhance the immune system's ability to attack cancers, have been successfully 
      introduced for the therapy of various malignancies including HCC. An important 
      target of these drugs is the PD-L1/PD-1 ligand/receptor pair and several 
      clinically available inhibitors of this pair exist. DATA SOURCES: A search of the 
      literature until April 20, 2019 was performed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database, the 
      Embase database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The 
      clinical studies describing treatment with PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors as monotherapy 
      in HCC patients were retrieved. Patient characteristics with relevance for 
      treatment efficacy, such as liver function, disease extend and previous 
      treatment, were extracted from identified articles. Response and survival 
      outcomes were the primary focus of the meta-analysis. Summary estimates of 
      response rates and survival were calculated using a random or fixed effect model, 
      depending on heterogeneity. Most common adverse effects were also recorded and 
      summarized. RESULTS: Three studies (two on nivolumab and one on pembrolizumab) 
      with a total of 400 patients were included in the analysis. The summary response 
      rate (RR) was 17.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.2%-21.4%]. The summary 
      disease control rate (DCR) was 56.6% (95% CI: 44.7%-68.5%). Summary progression 
      free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months (95% CI: 2.8-4.2 months). Summary overall 
      survival (OS) was 10.4 months (95% CI: 3.5-17.2 months). Adverse effect rate was 
      low and also consistent with the adverse effect profile of PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors 
      in other disease locations. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are the only 
      checkpoint inhibitors with data in HCC. Meta-analysis of their effectiveness 
      discloses rates not dissimilar to other systemic therapies available for this 
      disease. Of interest also are the observed long responses in a sub-set of 
      responders. Further development is clearly warranted.

TI  - Right ventricular function during trastuzumab therapy for breast cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s10554-021-02470-2 [doi]
AB  - Cardiotoxicity (CDT) is the main adverse effect related to trastuzumab (TTZ). The 
      role of the right ventricle (RV) in this context is not clear. We aimed to 
      evaluate the longitudinal changes in RV function during TTZ therapy and to 
      determine RV function changes associated with subclinical CDT. Breast cancer 
      patients underwent echocardiograms at the beginning of TTZ treatment (Exam 1) and 
      every 3 months during the first year (Exams 2, 3, and 4). Subclinical CDT was 
      defined as ≥ 12% relative reduction of left ventricle global longitudinal strain 
      (LV GLS). Twenty-five women (52.1 ± 13.1 y-o) were included. We found a decrease 
      in LV ejection fraction between the first and fourth exams (Ex1: 64.1% ± 4.9 vs 
      Ex4: 60.9% ± 4.9, p = 0.003) and the LV GLS gradually decreased during follow-up 
      (Ex1: - 20.6% ± 2.0; Ex2: - 19.4% ± 2.1; Ex3: - 19.2% ± 1.8; Ex4: - 19.0% ± 2.1, 
      all p < 0.05). RV GLS changed from baseline to 3 month and to 6 month (Ex1: 
      - 23.9% ± 1.6; Ex2: - 22.5% ± 2.1; Ex3: - 22.5% ± 2.3, all p < 0.05), and the RV 
      Fractional Area Change was lower in the third exam (Ex1: 44.3% ± 6.6 vs Ex3: 
      39.9% ± 6.0, p = 0.004). We found subclinical CDT in 13 patients (52%); worsening 
      in RV parameters did not differ between those with and without subclinical CDT. 
      In this sample, the RV function decreased during TTZ therapy and the decrease was 
      not associated to the observed LV cardiotoxicity.

TI  - A Retrospective, Single-Institution Experience of Bullous Pemphigoid as an 
      Adverse Effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14215451 [doi]
LID - 5451
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a class of cancer treatment drugs that stimulate 
      the immune system's ability to fight tumor cells. These drugs are monoclonal 
      antibodies targeting im-mune-inhibiting proteins on cancer cells, such as CTLA-4 
      and PD-1/PD-L1. Immune checkpoint inhibitors cause many immune-related adverse 
      events. Cutaneous toxicities are of the most common adverse effects and occur 
      with a range of severity. Bullous Pemphigoid is a rare adverse event with a high 
      impact on quality of life that may occur after immune checkpoint inhibitor 
      treatment. In this article, we investigate current research on immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors, cutaneous adverse events, and common presentations and treatments, 
      with a specific focus on Bullous Pemphigoid, its characteristics, onset timing, 
      and treatment. Significant findings include a negative skew in the onset of 
      presentation. Furthermore, we describe exclusive cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Drug-induced atrial fibrillation (AF) is considered an adverse effect 
      of chemotherapeutic drugs. AF is a crucial risk factor for stroke, heart failure, 
      myocardial infarction, and mortality. Pulmonary veins (PVs) are considered 
      triggers inducing AF, and the sinoatrial node (SAN) may modulate PV activity and 
      participate in AF genesis. AF was associated with early discontinuation of 
      trastuzumab in patients with breast cancer. However, whether trastuzumab directly 
      modulates the electrophysiological characteristics of PV and SAN remains unclear. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: ECG and conventional microelectrode system were used to 
      record rabbit heart rhythm in vivo and electrical activities in vitro from 
      isolated SAN, PV, and SAN-PV preparations. RESULTS: Trastuzumab reduced the 
      beating rate in isolated PV and SAN preparations at 1, 10, and 30 μM 
      (particularly in isolated SAN preparations) and induced burst firings in isolated 
      PV preparations at 10 μΜ. In addition, trastuzumab (10 μM) induced SAN-PV 
      conduction block and burst firings, which were blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K 
      inhibitor, 100 nM). Similarly, ECG recordings showed that acute intravenous 
      administration of trastuzumab (10 mg/kg) reduced rabbit heart rates. CONCLUSION: 
      Trastuzumab increased PV arrhythmogenesis through interfering with PI3K 
      signaling, which may contribute to the genesis of AF.

AB  - Docetaxel (DOCX) kills tumor cells through the formation of microtubules, calcium 
      ion influx, apoptosis, and inflammation. However, DOCX has adverse effect on 
      normal tissues through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), despite 
      the adverse effect was inhibited by antioxidants. We investigated the protective 
      role of selenium against DOCX-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial oxidative 
      injury in laryngotracheal epithelial (LARYN) cells of mice. Thirty-two mice were 
      divided into four groups (n = 8). The first group was used as a control. The 
      second and third groups were treated with sodium selenite (Na-Sel) and DOCX, 
      respectively. The fourth group was the combined group of Na-Sel and DOCX. At the 
      end of the experiment, LARYN mucosa and cells were obtained from the mice. In the 
      LARYN cells, the cell viability level was low in DOCX group, although glutathione 
      peroxidase activity and cell viability level were increased by the treatment of 
      Na-Sel. Increased lipid peroxidation, intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane 
      depolarization, cell death levels, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, caspase -3, and -9 
      activities in the DOCX group of LARYN cells were diminished by the treatment of 
      Na-Sel. In conclusion, DOCX increased mitochondrial ROS, cell death, and 
      inflammation in the LARYN cells, although the increase was reduced in the cells 
      by Na-Sel treatment. DOCX-induced adverse oxidant, inflammatory, and apoptotic 
      effects in the tissue might be reduced by the Na-Sel treatment.

PG  - 2223-6
LID - 10.1016/j.fct.2010.05.052 [doi]
AB  - Flaxseed oil (FO), which is rich in n-3 fatty acid, is commonly consumed by 
      breast cancer patients because of its potential anti-cancer effects. Trastuzumab 
      (TRAS) is the primary drug for epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive 
      breast cancer. We investigated in athymic mice whether combining dietary FO (8%) 
      with TRAS treatment (2.5 or 5mg/kg body weight) can cause better or adverse 
      effect on established human breast tumors overexpressing HER2 (BT-474). Control 
      tumors significantly grew 187%, TRAS2.5 treated tumors did not change, while 
      TRAS5, FO+TRAS2.5 and FO+TRAS5 treated tumors significantly regressed 75%, 89% 
      and 84%, respectively, after 4weeks treatment. Two weeks after stopping TRAS 
      treatment while continuing on same diet, tumor size in FO+TRAS2.5 group was 87% 
      lower than in TRAS2.5 group and was not different from TRAS5 group with or 
      without FO. Combined TRAS2.5 treatment with FO caused a significantly lower tumor 
      cell proliferation and higher apoptosis compared to TRAS2.5 treatment alone and 
      showed similar effect to TRAS5 treatment with or without FO. Hence, FO did not 
      interfere with TRAS but rather enhanced its tumor-reducing effects and combined 
      FO and low dose TRAS was as effective as high dose TRAS treatment.

TI  - Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity in Cancer Survivors: Predictors of 
      Long-Term Patient Outcomes.
PG  - 821-828
LID - jnccn20758 [pii]
LID - 10.6004/jnccn.2021.7026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a major 
      adverse effect of cancer treatment. However, its impact remains poorly 
      understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact associated with CIPN on 
      the lives of cancer survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A volunteer sample of 986 
      individuals who had received neurotoxic chemotherapy completed an anonymous, 
      cross-sectional survey. Outcomes assessed included CIPN symptoms, pain, 
      neuropathic pain, quality of life (QoL), physical activity, and comorbid health 
      conditions via the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire. RESULTS: 
      Respondents had a mean age of 58 years (SD, 10.7), and 83.2% were female. Most 
      were treated for breast (58.9%) or colorectal cancer (13.5%); had received 
      docetaxel (32.7%), paclitaxel (31.6%), or oxaliplatin (12.5%); and had completed 
      treatment 3.6 ± 3.5 years previously. We found that 76.5% of respondents reported 
      current CIPN. Respondents reporting severe CIPN had poorer QoL, more 
      comorbidities, and higher body mass index, and more often received multiple 
      neurotoxic chemotherapies than those with mild CIPN. Respondents who completed 
      the survey ≤1 year after completing chemotherapy did not differ in reported CIPN 
      or pain compared with respondents who completed chemotherapy ≥6 years earlier. 
      However, respondents who completed chemotherapy ≥6 years earlier reported better 
      QoL. Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed predictors of CIPN 
      severity as follows: F(7, 874) = 64.67; P<.001; R2 = 0.34, including pain (β = 
      -0.36; P<.001), burning pain (β = 0.25; P<.001), sex (male sex associated with 
      greater CIPN: β = 0.14; P<.001), years since completing chemotherapy (shorter 
      time associated with greater CIPN; β = -0.10; P<.001), age (β = 0.80; P=.006), 
      number of comorbid conditions (β = 0.07; P=.02), and body mass index (β = 0.07; 
      P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Respondents with a high CIPN symptom burden experienced 
      poorer general health and QoL. Improvements in CIPN may be more likely soon after 
      treatment. However, improvements in QoL may occur over time in those with chronic 
      symptoms. CIPN seems to have lasting impacts on cancer survivors, and 
      understanding risk factors is important to enable the design of further 
      preventive and therapeutic management strategies.

TI  - An Evaluation of the Efficacy of Compression Therapy Using Sleeves and Stockings 
      to Prevent Docetaxel-induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Breast Cancer Patients.
PG  - 689-694
LID - 10.18926/AMO/64119 [doi]
AB  - Taxanes are key drugs for patients with breast cancer. A major adverse effect of 
      taxanes is peripheral neuropathy (PN). To investigate the ability of compression 
      therapy using sleeves and stockings to prevent PN due to the taxane docetaxel, we 
      conducted a single-center historical control trial. Patients receiving docetaxel 
      at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles as first-line chemotherapy for breast 
      cancer were eligible. PN was evaluated using the common terminology criteria for 
      adverse events version 4.0. The primary endpoint was the incidence of allgrade PN 
      until 3 weeks after the fourth docetaxel administration. We evaluated 26 patients 
      in the intervention group and compared their data to those collected 
      retrospectively from 52 patients treated with docetaxel without compression. 
      Neither the incidence of all-grade PN until 3 weeks after the fourth docetaxel 
      administration (63.5% in the control group vs. 76.9% in the intervention group, 
      p=0.31) nor that of PN grade ≥ 2 (13.5% vs. 15.4%, p=0.99) differed between the 
      groups. In this study, the efficacy of compression therapy using sleeves and 
      stockings to prevent PN induced by docetaxel was not demonstrated. Further 
      clinical studies including medications or intervention are needed to reduce the 
      incidence and severity of PN induced by chemotherapy.

      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-positive breast cancer that, though 
      generally well-tolerated, is classically associated with side effects like 
      cardiotoxicity. Cytopenias can be seen but are generally secondary to other 
      chemotherapeutic agents used in conjunction with trastuzumab. Herein, we present 
      a case of recurrent severe thrombocytopenia following trastuzumab use that 
      resolved following discontinuation. Our patient then finished a year of 
      maintenance therapy with pertuzumab alone and is still in remission four years 
      later. This is the eleventh report of this severe adverse effect described in the 
      literature. This report contributes to the body of work describing this severe 
      side effect by illustrating a clear temporal relationship between trastuzumab and 
      severe thrombocytopenia, while also providing an alternate treatment option with 
      chemotherapy and pertuzumab monotherapy. Given that pertuzumab is typically only 
      used in addition to trastuzumab, evidence of its successful independent use is of 
      clinical value to patients who may not be able to tolerate trastuzumab.

TI  - The potential of DMXAA (ASA404) in combination with docetaxel in advanced 
      prostate cancer.
PG  - 23-9
AB  - 5,6-Dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is a vascular disrupting agent that 
      has demonstrated efficacy in combination with taxane-based chemotherapy in 
      patients with advanced cancer. Complementary modes of action, a lack of 
      pharmacokinetic interaction and distinct adverse effect profiles provide a strong 
      rationale for combining these anticancer agents. In a Phase II trial in men with 
      hormone refractory prostate cancer, DMXAA (ASA404) in combination with docetaxel 
      achieved a prostate-specific antigen response in more patients than docetaxel 
      therapy alone, and was generally well tolerated. Further clinical evaluation of 
      this combination in this patient population is warranted.

TI  - Neratinib, an irreversible ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients 
      with advanced ErbB2-positive breast cancer.
PG  - 1301-7
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2009.25.8707 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Neratinib is an oral, irreversible pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor. The efficacy and safety of neratinib were evaluated in two cohorts of 
      patients with advanced ErbB2-positive breast cancer-those with and those without 
      prior trastuzumab treatment-in an open-label, multicenter, phase II trial. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients in the two cohorts (prior trastuzumab, n = 66; no 
      prior trastuzumab, n = 70) received oral neratinib 240 mg once daily. The primary 
      end point was the 16-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate for the evaluable 
      population (prior trastuzumab, n = 63; no prior trastuzumab, n = 64), as assessed 
      by independent review. RESULTS: The 16-week PFS rates were 59% for patients with 
      prior trastuzumab treatment and 78% for patients with no prior trastuzumab 
      treatment. Median PFS was 22.3 and 39.6 weeks, respectively. Objective response 
      rates were 24% among patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 56% in the 
      trastuzumab-naïve cohort. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, 
      vomiting, and fatigue. Diarrhea was the most frequent grades 3 to 4 adverse 
      event, occurring in 30% of patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and in 13% 
      of patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment, which prompted dose reductions 
      in 29% and 4% of patients, respectively, but treatment discontinuation in only 
      one patient. No neratinib-related, grades 3 or 4 cardiotoxicity was reported. 
      CONCLUSION: Oral neratinib showed substantial clinical activity and was 
      reasonably well tolerated among both heavily pretreated and trastuzumab-naïve 
      patients who had advanced, ErbB2-positive breast cancer. Diarrhea was the most 
      common adverse effect but was manageable with antidiarrheal agents and dose 
      modification.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for treatment of advanced 
      or refractory cancers: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 73068-73079
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.12230 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To systematically evaluate the overall efficacy and safety of current 
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for treatment of patients with advanced or refractory 
      cancer. RESULTS: Fifty-one trials including 6,800 patients were included. The 
      overall response rates for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were 29% (95% CI: 1.53-2.41), 21% (95% CI: 17%-25%) 
      and 21% (95% CI: 16%-27%) respectively. While the overall adverse effects rate 
      for melanoma, NSCLC, RCC were 16% (95% CI: 6%-28%), 11% (95% CI: 8%-14%) and 20% 
      (95% CI: 11%-32%) respectively. Tumor PD-L1 expression and patient smoking status 
      might serve as biomarkers to predict response of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody 
      treatment. Compared to tumors with negative PD-L1 expression, tumors with 
      positive PD-L1 expression had a significantly higher clinical response rate 
      (41.4% versus 26.5%) with RR = 1.92 (95% CI: 1.53-2.41, P < 0.001). Smoker 
      patients also showed a significantly higher response rate (33.7%) than patients 
      who never smoked (4.2%) with RR = 6.02 (95% CI: 1.22-29.75, P = 0.028). Nivolumab 
      and Pembrolizumab were associated with significantly increased response rate (RR 
      = 2.89, 95% CI: 2.46-3.40, P < 0.001), reduced death risk (HR= 0.53; 95% CI: 
      0.48-0.57; P < 0.001), and decreased adverse effect rate (RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 
      0.30-0.80, P = 0.004) compared with other therapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 
      Clinical trials reporting response or safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for 
      advanced or refractory cancer patients published before January 31th 2016 were 
      searched in PubMed and EMBASE database. Meta-analyses using random effects models 
      were used to calculate the overall estimate. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
      antibodies have high response rates and low adverse effect rates for advanced or 
      refractory cancers.

TI  - Risk factors for lower extremity lymphedema after surgery in cervical and 
      endometrial cancer.
LID - 10.3802/jgo.2023.34.e28 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lower extremity lymphedema (LEL) is a well-known adverse effect 
      related to cervical and endometrial cancer (CEC); however, very few studies have 
      elucidated the clinicopathologic risk factors related to LEL. We investigated the 
      incidence and risk factors in patients who received primary surgery and/or 
      adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy for CEC. METHODS: We retrospectively 
      reviewed 2,565 patients who underwent primary surgery following CEC diagnosis 
      between January 2007 and December 2020. LEL diagnosis was based on objective and 
      subjective assessments by experts. We identified important predictors of LEL to 
      construct a nomogram predicting individual risks of LEL. For internal validation 
      of the nomogram, the original data were separated using the split-sample method 
      in a 7:3 ratio of training data and test data. RESULTS: Overall, 858 patients 
      (33.5%) received RT, 586 received external beam RT (EBRT), and 630 received 
      intracavitary RT. During follow-up period, LEL developed in 331 patients, with an 
      overall cumulative 5-year incidence of 13.3%. In multivariate analysis, age at 
      primary treatment, use of docetaxel-based chemotherapy, type of hysterectomy, 
      type of surgical pelvic lymph node (LN) assessment, number of dissected pelvic 
      and para-aortic LNs, and EBRT field were the independent predictors of LEL. We 
      subsequently developed the nomogram showing excellent predictive power for LEL. 
      CONCLUSION: LEL is associated with various treatment modalities, and their 
      interactions may increase the possibility of occurrences. De-escalation 
      strategies for treatment modalities should be considered to reduce LEL in 
      patients with CEC.

TI  - Pembrolizumab-induced myasthenia gravis-like disorder, ocular myositis, and 
      hepatitis: a case report.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors are the 
      emerging treatment for selected, high-grade malignancies. However, a small number 
      of patients are unable to tolerate its adverse effects, leading to 
      discontinuation of this potentially life-changing therapy. In this study, we 
      present a case of high-grade urothelial carcinoma patient, who experienced 
      neurocomplications during the first pembrolizumab administration. However, we 
      were able to limit the adverse effect by concomitant use of low-dose oral 
      steroids. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old Taiwanese female with high-grade 
      urothelial carcinoma of the left ureter came to the neurology clinic with 
      complaints of acute onset of bilateral ptosis 16 days after her first infusion of 
      pembrolizumab. It was found that she developed complete bilateral ptosis and 
      limited extraocular muscle movements. Myasthenia gravis-related antibodies and 
      repetitive stimulation test were negative. We diagnosed her with 
      pembrolizumab-induced myasthenia gravis-like disorder and myositis based on 
      clinical symptoms and elevation of muscle enzymes. We commenced 
      methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral steroid therapy with gradual 
      resolution of the symptoms. Three months later, the patient received a second 
      cycle of pembrolizumab with low-dose oral steroids without any complications. 
      CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab exerts its antitumor activity by interfering with the 
      binding of programmed death 1 and its ligand, programmed death ligand 1. As a 
      result, enhanced cytotoxic T cells can recognize tumor cells and induce cellular 
      death. However, neurological complications may be severe and require prompt 
      recognition and treatment. Our case demonstrated that concomitant use of low-dose 
      steroids and pembrolizumab might prevent such complications.

TI  - Improving survival and reducing toxicity with chemotherapy in advanced non-small 
      cell lung cancer : a realistic goal?
PG  - 71-84
AB  - The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC) has been debated over three decades, but it is only relatively recently 
      that chemotherapy has become a standard of care for this disease. In addition to 
      prolonging survival, chemotherapy can palliate distressing symptoms. Concerns 
      that the adverse effects of chemotherapy are likely to outweigh its benefits have 
      largely not been confirmed by quality-of-life data reported among patients with 
      good performance status. Platinum-based chemotherapy regimens in which cisplatin 
      or carboplatin are partnered by a third-generation cytotoxic drug such as 
      gemcitabine, paclitaxel or vinorelbine, have similar activity and efficacy, but 
      differ in adverse effect profiles. Response rates of 30-40% should be expected 
      with median and 1-year survival of 8-10 months and 30-40%, respectively. In the 
      second-line setting chemotherapy with docetaxel has been shown to be 
      significantly superior to best supportive care alone. In a recent trial that 
      compared docetaxel to the novel antifolate, pemetrexed the response rates and 
      survival rates did not differ, but the toxicity profile favored pemetrexed. 
      Overall, these data demonstrate that progress has been made in the use of 
      chemotherapy to improve survival in patients with NSCLC without increasing the 
      incidence of further toxicity. In the past, the potential to survive 1 year was 
      extremely small, whereas now many more patients reach this milestone as well as 
      the 2-year point. However, a plateau has probably been reached with existing 
      cytotoxic drugs and there is a general belief that the next significant advance 
      in the treatment of NSCLC will come from the addition of drugs that target 
      specific molecular pathways in sequence with standard chemotherapy regimens.

      treatment with pembrolizumab: a case study.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/1120009X.2022.2073162 [doi]
AB  - Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) against the programmed 
      death-1 receptor. Herein, we introduce a rare adverse effect during using 
      pembrolizumab. We present the case of an 80-year-old man with biopsy-proven 
      unresectable double primary squamous cell carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine 
      carcinoma of the lung. After using pembrolizumab for 10 months, he complained of 
      muscle weakness of both upper and lower extremities. In a nerve conduction study, 
      the repetitive nerve stimulation test in the abductor digiti minimi was 
      diagnostic of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS): low in the amplitude of 
      compound muscle action potential (1.4 mV), 28.6% decrement in the 5-Hz 
      stimulation, and 579% increment in the 50-Hz stimulation. The disease did not 
      progress after the discontinuation of pembrolizumab, even without any anti-cancer 
      treatment for 12 months. We believe our clinical experience of this rare and 
      unexpected adverse effect should be shared.

AB  - Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) approved for multiple 
      indications in a variety of malignancies. Although generally well tolerated, the 
      potential for significant adverse effects, specifically immune related adverse 
      effects (irAEs) needs to be taken into consideration. Several cases of bullous 
      pemphigoid have been reported as a cutaneous adverse effect of ICIs since 2015, 
      and there are recent reports of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP). We present the 
      case of an 84-year-old male with metastatic urothelial carcinoma on treatment 
      with pembrolizumab, who developed laryngeal mucous membrane pemphigoid as an 
      irAE. The diagnosis was based on patient's clinical history and serologic 
      testing, and supported by symptomatic improvement after ICI discontinuation and 
      immunosuppression. Pembrolizumab-induced MMP is a newly described and infrequent 
      irAE, requiring early suspicion and close monitoring for its diagnosis and 
      management.

TI  - Association Between ABCB1 Genetic Variants and Persistent Chemotherapy-Induced 
      Alopecia in Women With Breast Cancer.
PG  - 987-991
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.1867 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (pCIA) has been recently 
      described in patients with breast cancer and in its most severe form occurs in up 
      to 10% of these patients. Genetic risk factors associated with pCIA have not been 
      adequately explored. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with 
      pCIA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this genetic association study, 215 
      women with breast cancer treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy with a 
      follow-up of 1.5 to 10 years after the end of the treatment were recruited 
      retrospectively through 3 hospital oncology units across Spain between 2005 and 
      2018. Severe pCIA was defined as lack of scalp hair recovery (Common Terminology 
      Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, grade 2) 18 months or more after the 
      end of treatment. Patients with grade 2 pCIA were selected as cases, and those 
      with no sign of residual alopecia 12 months after the end of docetaxel treatment 
      were selected as controls. A genome-wide association study in a discovery phase 
      was conducted, and logistic regression was used to identify variants associated 
      with the risk to develop this adverse effect. The validity of the association was 
      addressed through a replication phase. EXPOSURES: Docetaxel-based chemotherapy. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genotypes of single-nucleotide variants associated 
      with pCIA. RESULTS: In total, 215 women with breast cancer (median age, 51.6 
      years; interquartile range, 44-60 years) were recruited (173 patients for the 
      discovery phase and 42 patients for the replication phase). In the discovery 
      phase, ABCB1 genetic variants were associated with risk to develop pCIA. In 
      particular, single-nucleotide variation rs1202179, a regulatory variant located 
      in an enhancer element that interacts with the ABCB1 promoter, was associated 
      with the occurrence of pCIA. This finding was validated in the replication cohort 
      (combined odds ratio, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.46-6.67; P = 3.946 × 10-8). This variant is 
      associated with ABCB1 mRNA expression, and the risk allele was associated with 
      decreased ABCB1 expression levels (P = 1.64 × 10-20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      This is the first study, to our knowledge, that identifies an association between 
      a regulatory variant in the ABCB1 gene and the occurrence of pCIA in patients 
      with breast cancer who were treated with docetaxel-based therapies. This finding 
      suggests an important insight into the biological mechanisms underlying pCIA and 
      opens the opportunity to explore personalized treatment of these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is an important adverse effect of adjuvant breast 
      cancer treatment with trastuzumab and three monthly left ventricular ejection 
      fraction (LVEF) monitoring is considered mandatory. The purpose of this study was 
      to gain insight into LVEF monitoring during adjuvant trastuzumab treatment in 
      clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a multicenter retrospective study 
      encompassing 328 patients, of which 171 patients were actually treated with 
      trastuzumab, we analyzed the frequency and mode of LVEF monitoring and compared 
      it with LVEF monitoring guidelines. RESULTS: The results indicated poor guideline 
      adherence. In 9% of patients trastuzumab was started in spite of a low LVEF (< 
      55%). In 24% of patients no valid baseline LVEF value was available. LVEF 
      measurements during treatment at three, six and 12 months were only performed in, 
      respectively, 53%, 40% and 30% of patients. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion 
      of patients are treated with trastuzumab, while LVEF monitoring is not adequately 
      performed. More attention should be paid to the implementation of (cardiac 
      assessment) guidelines in clinical practice.

      retrospective analysis.
PG  - 9669-9677
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-2073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 
      fluorouracil (TPF) regimen followed by intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on 
      locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: A total of 150 patients 
      with locally advanced NPC [American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2009 stage 
      IIIa-IVb] received 2 or 3 cycles of a TPF regimen as induction chemotherapy. A 
      group of 67 participants (TPF group) continued to receive TPF chemotherapy and 
      radiotherapy, and the remaining 83 participants (P group) received cisplatin 
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. RESULTS: A median follow-up of 35 months (4-66 
      months) showed that there was no significant difference between P group and TPF 
      group in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The incidence 
      rate of myelosuppression at 3-4 degrees was 16.9% and 34.3% in the P group and 
      TPF group (P=0.029), respectively, and the oral mucosa reaction at 3-4 degrees 
      was 18.1% and 37.3% in the P group and TPF group, respectively (P=0.007). The 
      3-4-degree skin reaction in the P group and TPF group was 15.7% and 29.9% 
      (P=0.030), respectively. The rate of liver function injury in the P group was 
      significantly lower than that in TPF group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 
      concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the concurrent TPF regimen 
      and IMRT showed no significant improvement in OS and PFS in patients with 
      advanced NPC, but exhibited more severe hematologic toxicity, oral mucosal 
      responses, skin reactions, and liver functional impairment.

LID - 8308179
AB  - Therapy related acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes 
      (MDS) have been classically linked to alkylating agents and topoisomerase 
      inhibitors. They constitute about 1% of all AMLs. There is less evidence on 
      association of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) with these myeloid neoplasms. 
      We present a case of paclitaxel therapy related acute myelogenous leukemia after 
      treatment of endometrial cancer with a regimen containing paclitaxel and 
      carboplatin. A 63-year-old female underwent surgery followed by a total of 6 
      cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Six months after last 
      cycle of chemotherapy, she was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome with 
      refractory anemia and excess blasts. Six weeks later, she had worsening anemia 
      and thrombocytopenia which prompted a bone marrow biopsy which revealed acute 
      myelomonocytic leukemia. A thorough literature review revealed 12 other case 
      reports where taxanes have been implicated in the development of therapy related 
      myeloid neoplasm. Based on the timeline of events in our patient, paclitaxel is 
      the likely culprit in the pathogenesis of this myeloid neoplasm. This rare but 
      significantly grave adverse effect should be kept in consideration when deciding 
      on treatment options for gynecological malignancies.

TI  - Role of docetaxel in the treatment of newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer.
PG  - 136s-144s
AB  - Docetaxel is currently licensed for use in a variety of malignancies, including 
      breast cancer and lung cancer, and is the preferred taxane in breast cancer 
      treatment. In ovarian cancer, the taxane of choice has historically been 
      paclitaxel; however, there is now substantial evidence that docetaxel also may be 
      the preferred taxane in this disease. Docetaxel has many preclinical advantages 
      over paclitaxel and has been shown to be effective in both platinum- and 
      paclitaxel-resistant disease. Phase I and II studies have shown docetaxel plus 
      carboplatin to be feasible, and the combination is associated with a tolerable 
      adverse-effect profile. The Scottish Randomized Trial in Ovarian Cancer (SCOTROC) 
      trial randomly assigned 1,077 patients with International Federation of 
      Gynecology and Obstetrics stage Ic to IV disease to six cycles of docetaxel plus 
      carboplatin (DC) or paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PC) as primary chemotherapy. 
      Progression-free survival is not statistically different, and to date, no 
      differences are apparent in overall survival. Toxicity differences were evident. 
      There was more myelosuppression with DC but no additional mortality. More 
      neuropathy was present with PC, with more patients stopping paclitaxel because of 
      this toxicity during chemotherapy. Quality-of-life analyses highlighted important 
      differences, all favoring the DC treatment arm. Additional SCOTROC studies using 
      docetaxel are ongoing. These data indicate that docetaxel and carboplatin 
      represent a reasonable first-line option for patients with newly diagnosed 
      epithelial ovarian cancer.

TI  - Measuring treatment preferences and willingness to pay for docetaxel in advanced 
      ovarian cancer.
PG  - 375-87
AB  - BACKGROUND: Docetaxel is an equally active alternative to paclitaxel in advanced 
      ovarian cancer but has a different adverse effect profile. Whilst paclitaxel is 
      associated with less haematological toxicity, such as febrile neutropenia and 
      anaemia, docetaxel causes less sensory and motor neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: To 
      measure the economic value and preference scores for docetaxel as an alternative 
      to paclitaxel in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: A 
      cost-benefit analysis using a consumer-based willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach 
      was conducted. The study population consisted of a patient surrogate sample 
      comprised of 80 oncology pharmacists and nurses from eight Canadian provinces. 
      Background information on ovarian cancer was provided including its current 
      management, and differences in adverse effects between docetaxel and paclitaxel. 
      Respondents were then asked what their preferred product would be if they were 
      diagnosed with ovarian cancer and how much they would be willing to pay per cycle 
      for six cycles in the form of a co-payment (i.e. user's fee) for the product of 
      their choice. The maximum willingness to pay for docetaxel was then compared 
      against the incremental cost (acquisition and administration) of the drug. STUDY 
      PERSPECTIVE: Canadian healthcare system perspective. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND 
      RESULTS: The WTP survey instrument was simple to administer and easily understood 
      by participants. Respondents ranked motor neuropathy as being the most unpleasant 
      adverse effect of treatment. Of the sample, 63.8% preferred to use docetaxel 
      instead of paclitaxel (p = 0.075). The patient surrogate sample was willing to 
      pay a mean of 64 Canadian dollars (dollars Can; 2003 values) [95% CI dollars 
      Can33, dollars Can92] per cycle for the benefits offered by docetaxel as an 
      alternative to paclitaxel. This estimate was marginally lower than the 
      incremental cost of dollars Can87 per cycle of docetaxel. CONCLUSION: A 
      substantial portion of Canadian patients with ovarian cancer would likely prefer 
      to be treated with docetaxel instead of paclitaxel for the management of their 
      disease and would be willing to pay a portion of the incremental cost. Therefore, 
      both options should be offered to patients, and selection of treatment can be 
      based on reducing the risk of the toxicity that concerns the patient the most.

AB  - A 70-year-old man presented with breathlessness, cough and fever while receiving 
      pembrolizumab for melanoma. A CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated small bilateral 
      upper lobe segmental pulmonary emboli with patchy ground-glass opacities and 
      basal perilobular consolidation, in keeping with organising pneumonia. He was 
      treated for community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary emboli but rapidly 
      deteriorated, with increasing hypoxia and dyspnoea. He was admitted to the 
      intensive care unit for support with continuous positive airway pressure and high 
      flow nasal oxygen. His clinical condition improved once he received high-dose 
      intravenous methylprednisolone to treat pneumonitis. His treatment was continued 
      with a weaning course of high-dose oral steroids, and he was discharged with a 
      persistent oxygen requirement. The patient maintained a requirement for high 
      doses of oral steroids and continued to deteriorate. He was referred to 
      palliative care for symptom management and died a month following hospital 
      discharge, as a result of pneumonitis due to pembrolizumab.

TI  - Real-World Analysis of the Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Irreversible HER2 
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Pyrotinib in Patients with HER2-Positive Metastatic 
      Breast Cancer.
PG  - 7165-7174
LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S321428 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a novel irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor recently approved in 
      China, pyrotinib has exhibited promising anticancer efficacy and acceptable 
      safety profile in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC). The aim of this 
      retrospective study was to estimate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib 
      treatment in Chinese mBC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the 
      real-world clinicopathological and treatment data of HER2-positive mBC patients 
      receiving pyrotinib-based treatment from August 2018 to July 2019 in Qilu 
      Hospital of Shandong University and other medical centers of Shandong Province in 
      China. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients treated with pyrotinib were included for 
      analysis, and the median follow-up duration was 260 days (interquartile range, 
      199.0 to 339.0 days). Fifty-nine (92.2%) patients had been previously treated 
      with trastuzumab and/or T-DM1, while 11 (17.2%) patients had been exposed to 
      lapatinib. The objective response rate (ORR) of all patients was 73.4%, and the 
      disease control rate (DCR) was 98.4%, with a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 
      87.5%. Patients with exposure to lapatinib responded well to pyrotinib-based 
      treatment, although the ORR was significantly lower compared with that of 
      patients without exposure to lapatinib (44.1% vs 77.5%, p=0.037). Previous 
      lapatinib exposure was negatively associated with the objective response of 
      pyrotinib treatment (odds ratio [OR]=0.248, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 0.063-0.970, p=0.045). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) for 
      patients with previous lapatinib exposure and patients with visceral metastasis 
      was 299 days (95% CI 240.1-357.9 days) and 359 days (95% CI 258.3-459.7 days), 
      respectively. But the mPFS of the whole cohort has not been reached until the 
      cut-off date. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that only visceral metastasis 
      was an independent predictor of significantly shorter PFS (p=0.041) but not 
      previous exposure to lapatinib (p=0.092). Diarrhea (28.1%), hand-foot syndrome 
      (17.2%), and neutropenia (9.4%) were the most common grade 3 adverse events 
      associated with pyrotinib treatment. CONCLUSION: Pyrotinib is highly beneficial 
      to HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients, even in patients with 
      previous lapatinib exposure. Pyrotinib is a feasible replacement of lapatinib in 
      combination with chemotherapeutic drugs or as a monotherapy. Adverse effects are 
      tolerable and easily manageable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) are new promising anti-cancer 
      drugs that block negative costimulation of T-cells leading to an enhanced 
      anti-tumor immune response. Pembrolizumab, an a monoclonal antibody, targeting 
      the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway. CPIs have been associated 
      with a number of immune-related adverse events (AEs), including musculoskeletal 
      and rheumatic disease. OBJECTIVE: To present a case with lung adenocarcinoma 
      treated with pembrolizumab, which developed inflammatory arthritis and fasciitis. 
      CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old male patient was referred to the rheumatology 
      outpatient clinic with complaints of pain in the pretibial area, pain and 
      swelling in both ankles joints and the right fırst metacarpophalangeal (MCP) 
      joint. Three months ago he had diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and 
      pembrolizumab was started. Locomotor system complaints were started after 
      receiving two infusions of pembrolizumab. Physical examination revealed both 
      ankle arthritis, mild edema in the pretibial region, tenderness in the muscles 
      and arthritis in the right fırst MCP joint. Laboratory examinations showed mild 
      acute phase reactants elevation. Lower extremity MRI showed diffuse edema in both 
      gastrocnemius muscle and fascia, compatible with fasciitis. Pembrolizumab-related 
      fasciitis and seronegative arthritis were diagnosed. Low dose corticosteroid was 
      started and a significant regression was observed in the patient's complaints. 
      CONCLUSION: Inflammatory myositis with fasciitis and inflammatory arthritis in 
      lower extremities appears to be a new adverse effect of pembrolizumab therapy.

TI  - Self-assembly of X-shaped antibody to combine the activity of IgG and IgA for 
      enhanced tumor killing.
PG  - 7729-7744
LID - 10.7150/thno.74903 [doi]
AB  - Rationale: IgA can induce activation of neutrophils which are the most abundant 
      cell type in blood, but the development of IgA as therapeutic has been confounded 
      by its short half-life and a weak ability to recruit NK cells as effector cells. 
      Therefore, we generated an X-shaped antibody (X-body) based on the principle of 
      molecular self-assembly that combines the activities of both IgG and IgA, which 
      can effectively recruit and activate NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils to 
      kill tumor cells. Methods: X-body was generated by using a self-assembly 
      strategy. The affinity of the X-body with the antigen and Fc receptors was tested 
      by surface plasmon resonance. The shape of X-body was examined using negative 
      staining transmission electron microscopy. The tumor cell killing activity of 
      X-body was assessed in vitro and in multiple syngeneic mouse models. To explore 
      the mechanism of X-body, tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed by 
      single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry. The dependence of neutrophil, macrophage, 
      and NK cells for the X-body efficacy was confirmed by in vivo depletion of immune 
      cell subsets. Results: The X-body versions of rituximab and trastuzumab combined 
      the full spectrum activity of IgG and IgA and recruited NK cells, macrophages, 
      and neutrophils as effector cells for eradication of tumor cells. Treatment with 
      anti-hCD20 and anti-hHER2 X-bodies leads to a greater reduction in tumor burden 
      in tumor-bearing mice compared with the IgA or IgG counterpart, and no obvious 
      adverse effect is observed upon X-body treatment. Moreover, the X-body has a 
      serum half-life and drug stability comparable to IgG. Conclusions: The X-body, as 
      a myeloid-cell-centered therapeutic strategy, holds promise for the development 
      of more effective cancer-targeting therapies than the current state of the art.

TI  - Pembrolizumab-Induced Lichen Planus on the Scalp of a Patient with Non-Small-Cell 
      Lung Carcinoma.
PG  - 487-491
LID - 10.1159/000519486 [doi]
AB  - A 67-year-old man with non-small-cell lung carcinoma was referred to our 
      department because of a pruritic rash on his head and upper extremities. Prior to 
      the development of the rash, he had received 4 cycles of combination therapy with 
      pemetrexed, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab, followed by 2 cycles of pembrolizumab 
      monotherapy. On physical examination, violaceous scaly erythema grouped on his 
      scalp and upper extremities. Histologically, the scalp lesions demonstrated 
      irregular acanthosis that formed a characteristic saw-tooth appearance with 
      hypergranulosis and typical lichenoid tissue reaction. These findings suggested 
      that the scalp lesions were lichen planus. Two-week administration of topical 
      corticosteroid dramatically improved the rash. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab, 
      an anti-PD-1 antibody, can induce T-cell activation that results in various 
      immune-related adverse effects such as lichenoid tissue reaction. However, lichen 
      planus is generally found on the extremities and/or oral mucosa, and unlike in 
      this case, the scalp is rarely affected. Although the exact mechanism underlying 
      predominant scalp involvement is unknown, the present case indicates that 
      anti-PD-1 therapy-induced lichen planus can develop not only on the extremities 
      and oral mucosa but also on the scalp. Interestingly, the lesions were not 
      induced by the combination of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab; rather, they 
      occurred soon after initiation of pembrolizumab monotherapy. In the present case, 
      pembrolizumab-induced T-cell activation which triggered lichenoid tissue reaction 
      may have been suppressed by chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. 
      Dermatologists should have a thorough knowledge of the cutaneous lesions that 
      manifest as irAEs of anti-PD-1 therapy.

TI  - Docetaxel versus docetaxel plus cisplatin for non-small-cell lung cancer: a 
      meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 57365-57378
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.17071 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the activity, efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel versus 
      docetaxel plus cisplatin in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: A 
      literature search was performed in the EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of 
      Science, China National Knowledge Internet, Wan-fang databases. The trials that 
      were found were then evaluated for eligibility. The Cochrane Collaboration's 
      Review Manager software was used to perform the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Nine 
      clinical trials including 1257 patients were included. The docetaxel plus 
      cisplatin regimens had higher overall response rates compared with the docetaxel 
      regimen (RR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.80; P < 0.00001). No statistically 
      significant difference was observed between the two regimens with respect to the 
      one-year survival rate (RR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P = 0.62). Patients 
      treated with the DP regimen were more likely to experience anemia, 
      thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting, nephrotoxicity, hyponatremia, mucositis and 
      treatment-related deaths compared with patients treated with docetaxel alone. No 
      significant difference was observed between the two regimens with respect to the 
      occurrence of neurotoxicity, diarrhea, fatigue, pneumonitis, neutropenia and 
      leucopenia. CONCLUSIONS: The docetaxel plus cisplatin combination regimen 
      resulted in a high response rate and a high adverse effect rate compared with 
      docetaxel monochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide common and rare variant analysis provides novel insights into 
      clozapine-associated neutropenia.
PG  - 1502-1508
LID - 10.1038/mp.2016.97 [doi]
AB  - The antipsychotic clozapine is uniquely effective in the management of 
      schizophrenia; however, its use is limited by its potential to induce 
      agranulocytosis. The causes of this, and of its precursor neutropenia, are 
      largely unknown, although genetic factors have an important role. We sought risk 
      alleles for clozapine-associated neutropenia in a sample of 66 cases and 5583 
      clozapine-treated controls, through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), 
      imputed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, exome array and copy-number 
      variation (CNV) analyses. We then combined associated variants in a meta-analysis 
      with data from the Clozapine-Induced Agranulocytosis Consortium (up to 163 cases 
      and 7970 controls). In the largest combined sample to date, we identified a novel 
      association with rs149104283 (odds ratio (OR)=4.32, P=1.79 × 10(-8)), intronic to 
      transcripts of SLCO1B3 and SLCO1B7, members of a family of hepatic transporter 
      genes previously implicated in adverse drug reactions including 
      simvastatin-induced myopathy and docetaxel-induced neutropenia. Exome array 
      analysis identified gene-wide associations of uncommon non-synonymous variants 
      within UBAP2 and STARD9. We additionally provide independent replication of a 
      previously identified variant in HLA-DQB1 (OR=15.6, P=0.015, positive predictive 
      value=35.1%). These results implicate biological pathways through which clozapine 
      may act to cause this serious adverse effect.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of CATS (Cardiotoxicity of Adjuvant Trastuzumab Study) was to 
      prospectively assess clinical, biochemical, and genomic predictors of 
      trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity (TRC). BACKGROUND: Cardiac dysfunction is a 
      common adverse effect of trastuzumab. Studies to identify predictive biomarkers 
      for TRC have enrolled heterogeneous populations and yielded mixed results. 
      METHODS: A total of 222 patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2-positive breast cancer scheduled to receive adjuvant anthracyclines 
      followed by 12 months of trastuzumab were prospectively recruited from 
      17 centers. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin T, and N-terminal 
      prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide were measured at baseline, 
      post-anthracycline, and every 3 months during trastuzumab. Germline 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ERBB2, FCGR2A, and FCGR3A were analyzed. TRC 
      was defined as symptomatic heart failure; cardiac death, arrhythmia, or 
      infarction; a decrease in LVEF of >15% from baseline; or a decrease in LVEF of 
      >10% to <50%. RESULTS: TRC occurred in 18 of 217 subjects (8.3%). Lower 
      pre-anthracycline LVEF and greater interval decline in LVEF from pre- to 
      post-anthracycline were each associated with TRC on multivariate analyses (odds 
      ratio: 3.9 [p = 0.0001] and 7.9 [p < 0.0001] for a 5% absolute change in LVEF). 
      Higher post-anthracycline N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide 
      level was associated with TRC on univariate but not multivariate analyses. There 
      were no associations between troponin T or ERBB2/FGCR polymorphisms and TRC. 
      Baseline LVEF and LVEF change post-anthracycline were used to generate a 
      "low-risk TRC score" to identify patients with low TRC incidence. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Low baseline LVEF and greater LVEF decline post-anthracycline were both 
      independent predictors of TRC. The other biomarkers did not further improve the 
      ability to predict TRC. (Cardiotoxicity of Adjuvant Trastuzumab [CATS]; 
      NCT00858039).

TI  - Severe thrombocytopenia induced by trastuzumab rechallenge: a case report and 
      literature review.
PG  - 1173-1177
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13406 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Trastuzumab can significantly prolong the survival 
      of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive breast 
      cancer. Trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare adverse effect. There have 
      been no reports of acute, grade 4 thrombocytopenia after weekly trastuzumab 
      therapy. The study reports a case of a breast cancer patient with severe 
      thrombocytopenia due to trastuzumab infusion (8 mg/kg). Moreover, the patient 
      experienced recurrence of severe thrombocytopenia after receiving weekly 
      trastuzumab therapy (4 mg/kg). CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old woman with 
      HER-2-positive breast cancer developed diffuse petechial haemorrhages and 
      ecchymosis on the lower limbs and gingival bleeding within 24 hours of 
      trastuzumab infusion (8 mg/kg). She was confirmed to have severe 
      thrombocytopenia, which quickly recovered after corticosteroid therapy and 
      platelet transfusion. When her platelet count recovered, we attempted weekly 
      trastuzumab therapy (4 mg/kg); however, thrombocytopenia recurred within 24 
      hours. Thus, we did not attempt further treatment with trastuzumab. WHAT IS NEW 
      AND CONCLUSION: We are the first to attempt weekly trastuzumab therapy after 
      thrombocytopenia induced by its initial administration. Reducing the trastuzumab 
      dose did not prevent trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia. Unlike other reports 
      with administration of high-dose corticosteroid, we found that a standard dose of 
      corticosteroid combined with platelet transfusion was effective in treating 
      trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia.

TI  - Docetaxel in anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 124-7
AB  - Docetaxel is a taxane that disrupts the equilibrium in the polymerization and 
      depolymerization of microtubules, thus inhibiting cell growth. This agent is 
      indicated for the treatment of anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer. 
      The dose-limiting adverse effect is neutropenia, but febrile neutropenia is 
      uncommon. Like paclitaxel, docetaxel is very active in patients with both 
      chemotherapy-resistant and refractory metastatic breast cancer. Although the 
      mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, and side effect profile of this agent 
      are similar to those of paclitaxel, docetaxel may be efficacious in patients with 
      metastatic breast cancer who have become resistant or refractory to paclitaxel 
      therapy. However, more studies are warranted before the role of docetaxel is 
      defined in patients with paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer.

LID - 10.2147/OTT.S183304 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate efficacy and safety of lapatinib or trastuzumab alone or both 
      plus chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer patients with positive HER-2 
      expression. METHODS: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, 
      MEDLINE, OVID, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and China Academic 
      Journals Database were searched from 1994 through December 2017 using the 
      keywords "breast cancer", "preoperative", "neo-adjuvant", "lapatinib", 
      "pertuzumab", "Herceptin", and "trastuzumab". RESULTS: Meta-analysis found that 
      pathological complete response (PCR; risk ratio [RR]=0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.93) and 
      tall PCR (tPCR; RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.88) of chemotherapy plus lapatinib were 
      significantly less effective or safe compared to that of chemotherapy plus 
      trastuzumab (P<0.05). PCR (RR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.15-1.47) and tPCR (RR=1.32, 95% CI: 
      1.16-1.50) of chemotherapy plus both lapatinib and trastuzumab were significantly 
      superior to that of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab alone (P<0.05). However, there 
      was no significant difference in breast reservation rate between chemotherapy 
      plus lapatinib vs chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (RR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.72-1.16) or 
      chemotherapy plus both lapatinib and trastuzumab (RR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.73-1.68, 
      P>0.05). Incidence of diarrhea, hepatic toxicity, and skin rash in the groups of 
      chemotherapy plus lapatinib or chemotherapy plus both lapatinib and trastuzumab 
      was significantly higher than that in chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (P<0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Efficacy of lapatinib was less than that of trastuzumab, but 
      incidence of adverse effect of lapatinib was higher than that of trastuzumab. 
      Combination of chemotherapy plus both lapatinib and trastuzumab could 
      significantly increase PCR and tPCR in breast cancer patients, but rate of breast 
      conservation, event-free survival, and overall survival was not significantly 
      improved. Incidence of diarrhea, hepatic toxicity, and skin rash was 
      significantly increased in the groups using lapatinib.

PG  - 116-121

AB  - Docetaxel is an anti-microtubule agent and a highly effective treatment of 
      locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer. There are several adverse effects 
      associated with docetaxel, such as myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, fluid 
      retention, and asthenia. One of the most well-known side-effects of this 
      medication is mild to moderate myalgia. Here, we report a case of a 49-year-old 
      female with stage 3 breast cancers who developed severe acute myositis following 
      docetaxel use. The mechanism of docetaxel-induced myositis remains unclear; 
      however, physicians still need to be aware of the possibility of this 
      complication in patients with cancer and a history of exposure to this 
      medication.

AB  - Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has recently started to play a fundamental 
      role in the management of metastatic melanoma. It is however accountable for many 
      undesirable adverse effects involving many organ systems. Eosinophilic fasciitis 
      is a rare immune-related adverse effect associated to checkpoint inhibitors such 
      as pembrolizumab and nivolumab. We report the case of a 25-year-old male who 
      received pembrolizumab as a second-line therapy for metastatic melanoma. 
      Approximately 8 months after starting the treatment, the patient developed signs 
      and symptoms of eosinophilic fasciitis, including edema of his hands and lower 
      legs, as well as joint limitation. Pembrolizumab was discontinued after 15 cycles 
      because of symptom progression. The patient experienced complete resolution of 
      symptoms 4 months after cessation of pembrolizumab and without corticosteroids. 
      This case illustrates the reversibility of this immune adverse effect by 
      discontinuation of the treatment, speculating that corticotherapy may not be 
      needed in all cases.

TI  - Trifluridine/Tipiracil (TAS-102) for refractory metastatic colorectal cancer in 
      clinical practice: a feasible alternative for patients with good performance 
      status.
PG  - 1781-1785
LID - 10.1007/s12094-019-02154-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to assess efficacy and safety and prognostic factors 
      associated with TAS-102 in clinical practice. METHOD: Retrospective, multicenter, 
      and observational study including patients with advanced refractory colorectal 
      cancer who started TAS-102 between March 2016 and August 2018. The primary end 
      point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free 
      survival, toxicity and analyze prognostic factors present at the beginning of 
      TAS-102. RESULT: 84 patients were evaluable. The median OS was 8.30 (95% CI 
      6.23-9.87) months and PFS was 2.62 (95% CI 2.36-3.05) months. In multivariate 
      analysis, ECOG 0 and reduced dose combined with more cycles were associated with 
      better prognosis. Patients with an ECOG > 0 had worse prognosis (HR 3.34, 95% CI 
      1.09-10.27, p = 0.035). 95.2% experienced some type of adverse effect and 45.2% 
      had grade ≥ 3 toxicities. CONCLUSION: Results suggest reconsidering TAS-102 in 
      patients with ECOG > 0, something that should be investigated in prospective 
      randomized clinical trials.

TI  - Febrile neutropenia in adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: a 
      retrospective study in routine clinical practice from a single institution.
PG  - 4097-4103
LID - 10.1007/s00520-018-4280-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is one of the most common and most critical 
      adverse effects of chemotherapy. Despite many existing guidelines based on the 
      use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), FN continues to impair the 
      quality of life and interfere with the treatment of many patients. The purpose of 
      this study was to assess the incidence and management of FN associated with 
      chemotherapy for early breast cancer in routine clinical practice. METHODS: All 
      patients with early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) treated by chemotherapy at 
      Institut Curie, Hôpital René Huguenin, in 2014 were retrospectively included. The 
      incidence and management of FN were reported. Risk factors associated with FN 
      were studied by robust-error-variance Poisson regression. RESULTS: A total of 524 
      patients received either neoadjuvant (N = 130) or adjuvant chemotherapy 
      (N = 394). Most patients (80%) were treated with a combination of 5-fluorouracil, 
      epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC100; 3 cycles) followed by docetaxel 
      100 mg/m(2) (D; 3 cycles). The overall incidence of FN was 17%. Eighteen percent 
      of patients received primary prophylaxis (PP) for FN with G-CSF, using 
      pegfilgrastim in 64% of cases and 74% of patients over the age of 70 received PP. 
      Less than 5% of patients who received PP experienced FN. Recurrent FN after 
      secondary prophylaxis was observed in 9% of patients. Forty-seven percent of 
      cases of FN occurred after the first cycle and 30% occurred after the fourth 
      cycle, corresponding to D ± trastuzumab (T). The FEC100 regimen was associated 
      with a relative risk of FN of 1.98 (p = 0.09). Autoimmune (AI) and inflammatory 
      diseases were associated with a higher risk of FN (RR 3.08; p < 0.01). No 
      significant difference in the incidence of FN was observed between adjuvant and 
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. FN was managed on an outpatient basis in 72% of cases. 
      Outpatients with FN were mainly treated by a combination of 
      amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin. Dose reduction or chemotherapy 
      regimen modification were necessary in 25% of patients after FN. No toxic death 
      was reported. CONCLUSION: The incidence of FN induced by adjuvant/neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy in ESBC is higher in routine clinical practice than in clinical 
      trials. AI or inflammatory diseases were significant independent risk factors for 
      FN. Primary prophylaxis in patients at risk (elderly, comorbid patients), 
      especially treated with the FEC regimen, is the keystone of management of this 
      adverse effect. Prevention and management of FN to ensure the patient's safety 
      and quality of life are a major issue for both medical oncologists and supportive 
      care physicians.

TI  - Trastuzumab treatment of invasive breast ductal carcinoma induces severe edema: a 
      case report.
PG  - 4185-4188
LID - 10.21037/tcr-22-1607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody which binds to the extracellular 
      domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is the first 
      biological drug approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. 
      However, trastuzumab exhibits a series of clinical adverse effects, including 
      cardiac toxicity, nerve damage, abnormal liver function, thrombocytopenia, etc. 
      CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 46-year-old female patient with invasive 
      breast ductal carcinoma (classified as Stage 2B) who developed a rare severe 
      edema in neck, face, chest, abdomen and both upper limbs after a single dose 
      trastuzumab treatment. The patient (~60 kg weight) was administered with 
      trastuzumab (420 mg) with an infusion time of 2 hours. The most severe edema 
      symptom was observed in patient's hands, in which the epidermis was markedly 
      transparent and tight. One month after trastuzumab administration, the patient 
      was administered with methylprednisone (80 mg per day) for 5 days. The edema in 
      patient's neck, face and both upper limbs was mildly reduced though the CT image 
      showed no significant reduction of edema. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab treatment for 
      breast cancer patients, particularly those who have an allergic constitution, may 
      have an adverse effect to develop severe edema, and treatment with 
      methylprednisone at early stage can reduce such adverse reaction.

      effects of enzalutamide in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
      METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data on 345 patients who had received 
      enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer in 20 hospitals (Kyoto 
      University Hospital and other satellite hospitals). Cox proportional hazards 
      regression analysis was performed to identify factors predicting 
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression after enzalutamide treatment and 
      logistic regression analysis for those associated with development of adverse 
      effects. RESULTS: PSA titers decreased by >50 % in 197 patients (57 %). The 
      median PSA progression free survival was 163 days. Gleason score >8 (HR 2.078, 
      95 % CI 1.37-3.153, P = 0.00058), performance status ≥1 (HR 2.292, 95 % CI 
      1.463-3.592, P = 0.000296), presence of bone metastasis (HR 1.774, 95 % CI 
      1.019-3.090, P = 0.0429), visceral metastasis (HR 2.127, 95 % CI 1.215-3.722, 
      P = 0.00823), previous steroid treatment (HR 1.780, 95 % CI 1.207-2.626, 
      P = 0.00361) and docetaxel treatment (HR 1.602, 95 % CI 1.051-2.442, P = 0.0284) 
      significantly predicted the efficacy of enzalutamide. Adverse effects, including 
      fatigue or appetite loss, occurred in 169 patients (49 %), 48 (18 %) of whom 
      stopped enzalutamide. Age >75 years (HR 1.980, 95 % CI 1.270-3.09, P = 0.00246) 
      and lower enzalutamide dose (HR 0.437, 95 % CI 0.255-1.270, P = 0.00249) were 
      significantly associated with development of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Enzalutamide treatment is effective in patients with castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer with low Gleason scores, good performance status, without bone or 
      visceral metastasis and no prior steroid or docetaxel treatment. Lower doses of 
      enzalutamide decrease the incidence of adverse effects, especially in older 
      patients.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, act by 
      inhibiting programmed death-1 and activating the T cells against cancer. An 
      imbalance in this immune response, however, could lead to immune-related adverse 
      events (irAEs) involving multiple organs like rash, fatigue, hypo and 
      hyperthyroidism, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and colitis, among others. Oral irAEs 
      are not uncommon among immune checkpoint inhibitors which include xerostomia, 
      dysgeusia, and lichenoid reactions; however, oral mucositis is rarely seen or 
      reported in patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors. We present 3 cases of this rare 
      complication in varying grades of severity. The patients were managed with 
      steroids, either topical or systemic, depending on the severity of the lesions 
      with either postponement or withholding therapy due to toxicity. Through this 
      article, we hope to bring to light this overlooked and underdiagnosed oral 
      adverse event associated with the use of immunotherapy and various treatment 
      options for its management.

TI  - Treatment Challenges and Survival Analysis of Human Epidermal Growth Factor 
      Receptor 2-positive Breast Cancer in Real World.
PG  - 22-27
LID - 10.4103/0971-5851.203511 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Advent of trastuzumab has brought tremendous changes in the survival of 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2)-positive breast cancer patients. 
      Despite the availability of the drug, it is still out of reach for many patients. 
      There is very limited real world data regarding treatment challenges and survival 
      analysis of these patients. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Primary objective is 
      disease-free survival (DFS) and secondary objective is overall survival (OS) and 
      toxicity profile. STATISTICS: Statistical analysis is done using GraphPad Prism 
      7.02. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all patients 
      diagnosed with Her2-positive (Her2+) nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer from 
      January 2007 to December 2013. RESULTS: In the period of this study, 885 patients 
      are diagnosed with carcinoma breast, of which 212 are Her2/neu positive (23.9%). 
      Of the 212 patients, only 76 (35.8%) patients received trastuzumab along with 
      chemotherapy. Patients receiving trastuzumab with chemotherapy have longer 5-year 
      DFS compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone, 92% and 52.6%, respectively 
      (P = 0.0001). Five-year OS is 90.5% and 41.7% in those patients who received 
      chemotherapy with and without trastuzumab, respectively (P = 0.0001). Seven 
      patients (9.45%) developed Grade II reversible diastolic dysfunction. Grade 
      II/III peripheral neuropathy due to paclitaxel is the main adverse effect seen in 
      21 patients. CONCLUSION: In spite of improvement in DFS and OS with trastuzumab, 
      the number of patient receiving targeted therapy is very low due to financial 
      constraints which need to be addressed to bridge the gap in survival of Her2+ 
      patients.

TI  - PD-L1-targeted microbubbles loaded with docetaxel produce a synergistic effect 
      for the treatment of lung cancer under ultrasound irradiation.
PG  - 1418-1430
LID - 10.1039/c9bm01575b [doi]
AB  - Immunotherapy is gradually becoming as important as traditional therapy in the 
      treatment of cancer, but adverse drug reactions limit patient benefits from 
      PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor drugs in the treatment of non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC). As a chemotherapeutic drug for NSCLC, docetaxel (DTX) can 
      synergize with PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors but increase haematoxicity and 
      neurotoxicity. Herein, anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-conjugated and 
      docetaxel-loaded multifunctional lipid-shelled microbubbles (PDMs), which were 
      designed with biologically safe phospholipids to produce synergistic antitumour 
      effects, reduced the incidence of side effects and promoted therapeutic effects 
      under ultrasound (US) irradiation. The PDMs were prepared by the 
      acoustic-vibration method and then conjugated with an anti-PD-L1 mAb. The 
      material features of the microbubbles and their cytotoxic effects, cellular 
      apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition were studied. A subcutaneous tumour model was 
      established to test the drug concentration-dependent and antitumour effects of 
      the PDMs combined with US irradiation, and an orthotopic lung tumour model 
      simultaneously confirmed the antitumour effect of this synergistic treatment. The 
      PDMs achieved higher cellular uptake than free DTX, especially when combined with 
      US irradiation. The PDMs combined with US irradiation also induced an increased 
      rate of cellular apoptosis and an elevated G2-M arrest rate in cancer cells, 
      which was positively correlated with PD-L1 expression. An in vivo study showed 
      that synergistic treatment had relatively strong effects on tumour growth 
      inhibition, increased survival time and decreased adverse effect rates. Our study 
      possibly provides a well-controlled design for immunotherapy and chemotherapy and 
      has promising potential for clinical application in NSCLC treatment.

TI  - Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine-Induced Pulmonary Toxicity: A Single-Institution 
      Retrospective Review.
PG  - 527-533
LID - 10.1159/000491574 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: T-DM1 is an antibody drug conjugate with proven efficacy in metastatic 
      breast cancer for progressive disease refractory to trastuzumab. Drug-induced 
      pneumonitis is a rare serious potential adverse effect. The purpose of this 
      review was to estimate the incidence of pulmonary toxicity at our institution. 
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data inclusive of 
      all women and men aged 18 years and older treated with T-DM1 at out institution 
      was undertaken. The records were reviewed for clinical symptoms and/or 
      radiographic evidence concerning for pneumonitis. We identified variables of 
      interest with regard to potential risk factors for toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 
      50 patients were included, 6 (12$) of whom had radiographic and/or clinical 
      symptoms concerning for T-DM1-induced pneumonitis. All 6 patients had metastatic 
      or unresectable breast cancer. Of the 6 patients, 5 (83$) had suspected pulmonary 
      metastases, 1 (17$) had a history of underlying lung disease, and 5 (83$) had a 
      history of prior taxane therapy. Pulmonary metastases (p = 0.38), the median 
      number of treatment cycles (p = 0.29), prior taxane therapy (p = 0.99), 
      underlying lung disease (p = 0.99), and hormone receptor positivity (p = 0.66) 
      did not have any statistical significance for an association with pneumonitis. 
      CONCLUSION: Pneumonitis is a recognized toxic effect of T-DM1. While our sample 
      size was small, the number of events was higher than described in the literature, 
      which may be an artifact of referral bias. Future studies with a larger sample 
      population may detect potential risk factors for toxicity.

TI  - Myasthenia gravis, myositis and myocarditis: a fatal triad of immune-related 
      adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.
LID - 10.1136/bcr-2022-251966 [doi]
LID - e251966
AB  - Pembrolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody and immune checkpoint inhibitor 
      (ICI) that blocks programmed death receptor 1 and its ligands, is an effective 
      immunotherapy for malignancies such as melanoma, lung, head and neck, cancers, 
      and Hodgkin's lymphoma. It has an overall response rate between 73% and 83%, with 
      complete response rate of 27%-30%. It is well tolerated with minor side effects 
      in 70% of cases characterised by fatigue, rash, pruritus and diarrhoea. In rare 
      cases, more serious and life-threatening complications can occur at a rate of 
      0.3%-1.3%. We report a case of a woman in her 70s with non-small-cell lung cancer 
      treated with ICI. She presented to the emergency department with left-sided 
      ptosis and muscle weakness 3 weeks of her first dose of pembrolizumab infusion as 
      a treatment plan of her cancer. She was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, 
      myocarditis and myositis as ICI-induced immune-related adverse effects resistant 
      to medical intervention. We wish to raise awareness of the triad of 
      life-threatening complication of ICI therapy that accounts for 30%-50% of fatal 
      complications.

TI  - Docetaxel secretion in tears: association with lacrimal drainage obstruction.
PG  - 1180-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that docetaxel may be secreted in tears after 
      intravenous infusion. DESIGN: Prospective pilot trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tear 
      fluid was collected from 4 patients receiving docetaxel weekly and 2 patients 
      receiving docetaxel every 3 weeks as a single agent for the treatment of 
      metastatic breast cancer. Tear samples were collected once prior to and again 
      within 30 minutes following the end of the 1-hour docetaxel infusion. A blood 
      sample was also obtained after infusion. The tear and plasma samples were 
      analyzed for drug content using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem 
      mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Docetaxel was found in the tear samples collected 
      from all 6 patients. CONCLUSION: The secretion of docetaxel in tears may be a 
      mechanism for canalicular inflammation and tear drainage obstruction, which are 
      known to occur as an adverse effect of the drug.

TI  - Addition of Nimotuzumab to Standard TPF Regimen in Locally Advanced Head and Neck 
      Cancer: A Single Institutional Study.
PG  - 6641963
LID - 10.1155/2021/6641963 [doi]
LID - 6641963
AB  - BACKGROUND: Induction docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy 
      followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiation remains the standard of care in 
      locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck cancers despite which 
      the survival remains low. So, we analyzed the efficacy and adverse effect profile 
      of the addition of nimotuzumab to standard TPF induction chemotherapy. Methods. 
      We included 20 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
      and neck. Patients were administered with induction chemotherapy with nimotuzumab 
      plus docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF + N) followed by definitive 
      concurrent chemoradiation with carboplatin. Treatment responses were assessed by 
      PET-CT following induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation. Response 
      rates, survival, and adverse effects data were tabulated and analyzed using the 
      Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of two years, the median 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) were 16 months 
      and 38 months, respectively. PFS and OS were not reached (NR) in patients who 
      showed a complete radiological response (CR). Median PFS and OS in patients who 
      had partial response were 17.6 and 34.5 months, respectively. All subsites of 
      primary including oral cavity, hypopharynx, and oropharynx showed similar 
      response rates and survival. Overall the treatment was well tolerated with 
      predominantly grade 1/2 toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with locally advanced 
      head and neck cancer could possibly have a better response and survival with 
      nimotuzumab added to the standard TPF regimen. A complete response may serve as a 
      good surrogate for survival irrespective of the primary site of head and neck 
      cancer.

TI  - Fruquintinib in Combination With PD-1 Inhibitors in Patients With Refractory 
      Non-MSI-H/pMMR Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Real-World Study in China.
PG  - 851756
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.851756 [doi]
LID - 851756
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruquintinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
      inhibitor, is a new anticancer drug independently developed in China to treat 
      refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In Japan, regorafenib combined 
      with nivolumab has been demonstrated to be promising in patients with refractory 
      mCRC. Here, in a real-world study, we were aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 
      fruquintinib with various programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors after standard 
      treatment in Chinese non-microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair 
      proficient mCRC patients. METHODS: A total of 45 patients with refractory mCRC 
      were involved in the study. They received fruquintinib (3 or 5 mg, orally 
      administered once a day for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off in 4-week cycles) and 
      a PD-1 inhibitor(200 mg pembrolizumab, 3 mg/kg nivolumab, 200 mg sintilimab or 
      camrelizumab, intravenously administered on D1 once every 3 weeks). 
      Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate 
      (DCR), and objective response rate (ORR) were reviewed and evaluated. RESULTS: 
      Among the 45 patients, the median age was 54 years (29-85). The ORR was 11.1% 
      (5/45), DCR 62.2% (28/45), median PFS equal 3.8 months, and median OS was 14.9 
      months. The response duration was 3.4 months. PFS between left and right primary 
      tumors and PFS with or without lung metastases were both not significantly 
      different (p > 0.05), which was inconsistent with the result of REGONIVO study. 
      The multivariate analysis indicated no association of OS benefit in the specified 
      subgroups. No adverse-effect-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Fruquintinib, in combination with anti-PD-1, was observed to have clinical 
      activity in a small population of patients with heavily pretreated mCRC in our 
      center. Further studies are needed to verify this outcome in a large population.

TI  - Antitumor effects and normal-tissue toxicity of 111In-nuclear localization 
      sequence-trastuzumab in athymic mice bearing HER-positive human breast cancer 
      xenografts.
PG  - 1084-91
LID - 10.2967/jnumed.109.072389 [doi]
AB  - (111)In-nuclear localization sequence-trastuzumab is a radioimmunotherapeutic 
      agent consisting of trastuzumab modified with NLS peptides (CGYGPKKKRKVGG) and 
      labeled with the Auger electron emitter (111)In. Our objectives were to evaluate 
      the tumor growth-inhibitory properties and normal-tissue toxicity of 
      (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab in mice after intraperitoneal administration. METHODS: 
      The pharmacokinetics of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab after intravenous (tail vein) or 
      intraperitoneal injection in BALB/c mice were compared. Normal-tissue toxicity 
      was determined in BALB/c mice at 2 wk after intraperitoneal injection of 3.7-18.5 
      MBq (4 mg/kg) of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab by monitoring body weight, 
      histopathologic examination of tissues, and hematology (white blood cell, 
      platelet, red blood cell, and hemoglobin) or clinical biochemistry (alanine 
      transaminase and creatinine) parameters. A no-observable-adverse-effect-level 
      (NOAEL) dose was defined. Athymic mice bearing subcutaneous MDA-MB-361 or 
      MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts (5.0 x 10(5) or 0.5 x 10(5) HER2/cell, 
      respectively) were treated with a single NOAEL dose or 2 doses administered 
      intraperitoneally and separated by 2 wk. Control groups were administered 
      (111)In-trastuzumab, trastuzumab, nonspecific (111)In-NLS-human IgG (hIgG), or 
      normal saline. RESULTS: The bioavailability of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab after 
      intraperitoneal injection was 0.7. The NOAEL dose was 9.25 MBq (4 mg/kg); doses 
      greater than or equal to 18.5 MBq decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, 
      and doses of 27.7 MBq decreased red blood cell counts. There was no increase in 
      alanine transaminase or creatinine at any doses tested. There were no morphologic 
      changes to the liver, kidneys, heart, or spleen or loss of body weight. A single 
      dose of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab (9.25 MBq)-compared with mice receiving 
      (111)In-trastuzumab, trastuzumab, (111)In-NLS-hIgG, or normal 
      saline-significantly slowed the rate of growth of MDA-MB-361 tumors over 60 d 
      (0.014 d(-1) vs. 0.033 d(-1), 0.046 d(-1), 0.030 d(-1), and 0.061 d(-1), 
      respectively; P < 0.05). (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab had no effect on the growth of 
      MDA-MB-231 tumors. Two doses of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab (9.25 MBq; 4 mg/kg) 
      separated by 2 wk increased the survival of mice with MDA-MB-361 tumors, compared 
      with mice treated with trastuzumab or normal saline (>140 d vs. 96 and 84 d, 
      respectively; P < 0.001 or 0.027, respectively). CONCLUSION: 
      (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab is a promising radioimmunotherapeutic agent that could be 
      effective for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in humans.

TI  - Safety Evaluation of Initial CT-P6 Administration for 30 min during the Switch 
      from Reference Trastuzumab in Maintenance Infusion: A Multicenter Observational 
      Study.
PG  - 474-477
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b20-00984 [doi]
AB  - CT-P6 is a biosimilar of trastuzumab and is recommended to be administered for 
      30-90 min in subsequent maintenance infusions to prevent infusion-related 
      reactions (IRRs). We administered CT-P6 for 30 min as the first injection and as 
      an alternative to reference trastuzumab in the maintenance infusion and evaluated 
      the safety of the administration. A total of 140 patients with breast or gastric 
      cancer, who received a switch from tri-weekly reference trastuzumab to CT-P6 for 
      30 min in maintenance infusions, were retrospectively evaluated. Premedication 
      was administered prior to an infusion of CT-P6 and a cytotoxic agent. However, 
      premedication was not provided when CT-P6 was co-administered with pertuzumab or 
      administered alone. The primary endpoint was the incidence of IRRs. The secondary 
      endpoint was the incidence of diarrhea and skin toxicity. Ninety-five percent of 
      the patients had breast cancer, and 44.3% had advance-stage cancer. The treatment 
      included CT-P6 alone (17.9%) or with cytotoxic agents (23.6%), antihormonal drugs 
      (25.7%), and pertuzumab (62.9%). Median administration time of trastuzumab at the 
      switch was 13 administrations (range 2-140). Premedication was administered to 
      20.7% patients. One patient (0.7%) experienced grade 3 IRR. The frequency of 
      diarrhea in the reference trastuzumab group and the CT-P6 group was 7.1 and 6.4%, 
      respectively, and that of skin toxicity was 6.4 and 5.0%, respectively, without 
      differences. In conclusion, we first demonstrated that an initial CT-P6 
      administration for 30 min during the switch from reference trastuzumab in 
      maintenance infusion is an acceptable administration method.

TI  - Oral cryotherapy for prophylaxis of oral mucositis caused by docetaxel, 
      cisplatin, and fluorouracil chemotherapy for esophageal cancer.
PG  - 207-213
LID - 10.1007/s10388-018-00655-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy, including preoperative chemotherapy, plays an important 
      role in the treatment of esophageal cancer. However, although docetaxel, 
      cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) therapy has a powerful antitumor effect, the 
      associated adverse events make it difficult to maintain the patient's general 
      condition. Oral mucositis is an important adverse effect of chemotherapy, and its 
      severity, frequency, and impact on patient quality of life should not be 
      underestimated. This study evaluated the role of oral cryotherapy for prophylaxis 
      of oral mucositis caused by DCF therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the 
      incidence and severity of adverse events, including mucositis, in 72 patients 
      with esophageal cancer treated with DCF. Fifty-eight patients received 
      cryotherapy during docetaxel administration and 14 received no cryotherapy. 
      RESULTS: The incidence of mucositis of all grades and grade 3 was significantly 
      lower in the cryotherapy group compared with the no-cryotherapy group (24.1% vs. 
      71.4%, P < 0.001 and 0% vs. 28.6%, P = 0.001, respectively). The incidence of 
      anorexia of all grades and grade 3 was also significantly lower in the 
      cryotherapy group (22.4% vs. 57.1%, P = 0.037 and 0% vs. 28.6%, P = 0.010, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive oral cryotherapy is effective for the 
      prophylaxis and relief of oral mucositis and anorexia caused by chemotherapy.

PG  - 563-5
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12416 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Unexplained thrombocytopenia is a common clinical 
      problem, and the possibility of drug-induced thrombocytopenia must be considered. 
      Moreover, chemotherapy agents are known to typically cause thrombocytopenia by 
      suppressing haematopoiesis, but they can also cause immune thrombocytopenia in 
      which the mechanism involves antibody-mediated platelet destruction. CASE 
      DESCRIPTION: We report a case of severe thrombocytopenia related to trastuzumab 
      administration in which the patient exhibits a slow drift downward in platelet 
      counts with repeated cycles of trastuzumab. A 70-year-old woman received a 
      diagnosis of breast cancer and was treated with trastuzumab. She was confirmed to 
      have a severe trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia after the 4th cycle. 
      Retreatment with trastuzumab was not attempted. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: 
      Considering that trastuzumab is being increasingly used and that severe 
      thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening complication, its association 
      must be seriously considered.

PG  - 125

AB  - BACKGROUND: The docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin (DCF) regimen is an 
      effective form of chemotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer. However, the 
      incidence of adverse events such as febrile neutropenia and hematological 
      toxicity is high. METHODS: Among 937 patients with esophageal cancer at Toranomon 
      Hospital between January 2011 and December 2018, 92 who underwent the DCF regimen 
      as initial treatment were selected. We investigated the risk factors for febrile 
      neutropenia in patients with esophageal cancer treated with DCF regimen and the 
      effectiveness of pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis. RESULTS: Adverse events 
      (CTCAE grade ≥ 3) were observed in 45 of the 92(48.9%) patients with esophageal 
      cancer treated with an initial DCF regimen. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 
      20 (21.7%) patients. Non-use of pegfilgrastim (odds ratio = 16.393; 95% 
      confidence interval 2.049-125.0) as primary prophylaxis was identified as an 
      independent factor predictive of febrile neutropenia. The pegfilgrastim group had 
      a significantly lower incidence of neutropenia than the control group (9.1% vs 
      61.0%; p < 0.001). The incidence of febrile neutropenia was 3.0% in the 
      pegfilgrastim group and 32.2% in the control group (p = 0.001). In addition, the 
      incidence of any adverse effect ≥ CTCAE grade3 was also significantly lower in 
      the pegfilgrastim group (12.1% vs 69.5%; p < 0.001). The reduced/interruption 
      rate of next DCF therapy was 6.1% in the pegfilgrastim group and 30.5% in the 
      control group (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the non-use of 
      pegfilgrastim was an independent factor predictive of febrile neutropenia in 
      multivariate analysis. Pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis prevents severe 
      neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in patients with esophageal cancer treated 
      with the DCF regimen.

TI  - Docetaxel delivers new management opportunities for gastrointestinal carcinomas.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - The results of four phase II studies of docetaxel in cancers of the 
      gastrointestinal tract are summarized. No prior chemotherapy was permitted except 
      for adjuvant chemotherapy completed at least 1 year before entering the present 
      study. In all studies, docetaxel was administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 given by 
      intravenous infusion over 1 h once every 3 weeks, adjusted according to toxicity. 
      Routine premedication for hypersensitivity reactions was given to most patients 
      in the US study in colorectal cancer but not to patients in the three European 
      studies in gastric, pancreatic and colorectal cancers. In a European Organization 
      for Research on Treatment of Cancer--Early Clinical Trials Group (EORTC-ECTG) 
      study in gastric cancer, 8 (24%) of 33 evaluable patients achieved partial 
      remissions lasting for a median of 7.5 months. Responses occurred in a variety of 
      metastatic sites. Forty-two patients were evaluable in a French study of 
      docetaxel in pancreatic cancer. Partial responses were achieved in 6 (20%) of 30 
      patients with metastatic disease and 3 of 12 patients with loco-regional disease 
      showed some improvement. Two studies in colorectal cancer--one European and one 
      US--found that docetaxel had little or no activity in these patients. Three (9%) 
      of 33 evaluable patients in the European study achieved responses (one complete 
      and two partial) and none of 19 patients in the US study. Hematological toxicity 
      was the dose-limiting adverse effect. Acute hypersensitivity reactions and fluid 
      retention also occurred in some patients. In conclusion, docetaxel appears to be 
      as effective as standard single-agent therapies for gastric and pancreatic 
      cancers but to have minimal effect in colorectal carcinoma. Toxicities were 
      generally manageable; premedication with corticosteroids may reduce the incidence 
      and severity of acute hypersensitivity reactions and delay the onset of fluid 
      retention.

TI  - Assessment of tumor necrosis factor alpha blockade as an intervention to improve 
      tolerability of dose-intensive chemotherapy in cancer patients.
PG  - 1852-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Maintaining dose-intensity with chemotherapeutic agents is hindered by a 
      number of adverse effects including asthenia/fatigue. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
      is one of the cytokines responsible for the fatigue and cachexia associated with 
      malignancies. We used etanercept (TNF-decoy receptor) to maintain dose-intensity 
      of weekly docetaxel. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Initially, 12 patients with advanced 
      malignancies were randomly assigned to either docetaxel 43 mg/m2 weekly alone 
      (cohort A) or the same docetaxel dose plus etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice 
      weekly (cohort B). Subsequently, higher doses of docetaxel in combination with 
      etanercept were evaluated. Pharmacokinetics (PKs), nuclear factor-kappa B 
      (NF-kappaB) activation, and intracellular cytokines levels were measured. 
      Patients completed weekly questionnaires quantifying asthenia/fatigue. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-nine of 36 intended docetaxel doses during the first cycle were delivered 
      in cohort A, and 35 of 36 doses were delivered in cohort B (P = .055). Three 
      cohort B patients received additional cycles in the absence of disease 
      progression or severe toxicity, whereas no patients from cohort A received 
      additional cycles. Escalation to docetaxel 52 mg/m2 weekly with etanercept 
      resulted in neutropenia, not fatigue, as the limiting adverse effect, and the 
      addition of filgrastim permitted the maintenance of dose-intensity in additional 
      patients. Patients randomly selected to receive etanercept/docetaxel 
      self-reported less fatigue (P < .001), and docetaxel PKs show no relevant 
      influence of etanercept. NF-kappaB activation and increased expression of 
      TNF-alpha were associated with increments in docetaxel dose. Antitumor activity 
      was noticed exclusively in patients receiving etanercept. CONCLUSION: The 
      addition of etanercept is safe and had no impact on docetaxel concentrations. The 
      significant improvement in tolerability and the trend toward preservation of 
      dose-intensity suggests further exploration of TNF blockade as an adjunct to 
      cancer therapies.

TI  - Development and psychometric evaluation of the chemotherapy-induced peripheral 
      neuropathy assessment tool.
PG  - E10-20
LID - 10.1097/NCC.0b013e31820251de [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can be a 
      debilitating and dose-limiting adverse effect of chemotherapy. Comprehensive 
      self-report tools for CIPN are needed for research and clinical practice. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this psychometric study was to describe the development 
      and evaluate the reliability and validity of a new self-report tool designed to 
      measure CIPN, the Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment Tool 
      (CIPNAT). METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven patients receiving outpatient 
      chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin completed the 
      CIPNAT. Content validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, test-retest 
      reliability, and internal consistency reliability were assessed. RESULTS: Content 
      validity index was very acceptable at 0.95. Convergent validity data were 
      provided by correlation with a measure of the same concept (r = 0.83, P < .001), 
      and differences between contrasting groups (t = 7.66, P < .001) provided evidence 
      of discriminant validity. High test-retest correlations (r = 0.92, P < .001), 
      Cronbach α (α = .95), and significant item-to-total correlations ranging from 
      0.38 to 0.70 provided evidence of reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide 
      evidence of the validity and reliability of the CIPNAT, which can be used for 
      comprehensive assessment of CIPN. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Use of the CIPNAT in 
      research may lead to a better understanding of CIPN and guide nurses in 
      developing and testing of interventions to relieve suffering and enhance quality 
      of life for patients with CIPN.

TI  - WNT5A augments cell invasiveness by inducing CXCL8 in HER2-positive breast cancer 
      cells.

LID - 10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155213 [doi]
AB  - WNT5A is abnormally increased in a variety of cancers including breast cancer and 
      has an adverse effect on the prognosis. However, the biological function of WNT5A 
      is not fully known in HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. Using public clinical 
      data, we analyzed disease-free survival (DFS) and distant metastasis-free 
      survival (DMFS). Here, we found that abnormal WNT5A induction is a correlation 
      with the poor prognosis of HER2+ breast cancer. WNT5A expression was also 
      decreased by pan-HER inhibitor neratinib but not by trastuzumab. In addition, 
      WNT5A augmented cell invasiveness of HER2+ breast-cancer cells. To find 
      WNT5A-induced metastatic-related factors, we did a human cytokine array. The 
      levels of GM-CSF and CXCL8 were significantly increased by WNT5A. CXCL8 also 
      accelerated cell invasiveness in HCC1954 breast-cancer cells. The expression of 
      CXCL8 induced by WNT5A has been significantly reduced by MEK inhibitor, 
      binimetinib. Finally, we studied the effect of CXCR2 antagonist, SB225002, to 
      verify the relevance of CXCL8 in WNT5A-induced cell invasion. As expected, we 
      found that WNT5A-induced cell invasion is completely inhibited by SB225002. Taken 
      together, we have demonstrated that WNT5A directly mediates cell invasion through 
      the induction of CXCL8 and ultimately affects the survival rate of HER2+ breast 
      cancer.

TI  - Experience with combination of docetaxel, cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil 
      chemotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
PG  - 464-71
LID - 10.1007/s10147-012-0403-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, 
      fluorouracil, and docetaxel chemotherapy plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy 
      (IMRT) for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: Sixty 
      patients with locoregionally advanced NPC were enrolled. Patients received IMRT 
      plus three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and two courses of adjuvant 
      chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (60 mg/m(2)/day on day 1), cisplatin (25 
      mg/m(2)/day on days 1-3), and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-3). 
      RESULTS: The overall response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 89 %. Three 
      months after the completion of radiotherapy, 53 (93 %) patients achieved complete 
      regression, 3 (5 %) achieved partial response (PR), and 1 experienced liver 
      metastasis. However, among the 3 PR patients, 2 patients had no evidence of 
      relapse in the follow-up. With a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 6-43), the 
      2-year estimated locoregional failure-free survival, distant failure-free 
      survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 96.6, 93.3, 89.9, 
      and 98.3 %, respectively. Leukopenia was the main adverse effect in chemotherapy; 
      14 patients experienced grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia, and 1 patient developed 
      febrile neutropenia. The nonhematological adverse events included alopecia, 
      nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea. The incidence of grade 3 acute 
      radiotherapy-related mucositis was 28.3 %; no grade 4 acute mucositis was 
      observed. No grade 3 or grade 4 hematological toxicity occurred during 
      radiotherapy. None of the patients had interrupted radiotherapy. The common late 
      adverse effects included xerostomia and hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Neoadjuvant-adjuvant chemotherapy using cisplatin, fluorouracil, plus docetaxel 
      combined with IMRT was an effective and well-tolerated alternative for advanced 
      NPC.

TI  - Clinical Complete Response of Recurrent Gastric Cancer after Third-line CPT-11 
      Chemotherapy.
LID - 10.2302/kjm.2022-0004-CR [doi]
AB  - A 75-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer in 
      September 2018. During the adjuvant chemotherapy, computed tomography (CT) 
      revealed recurrence sites in the liver and para-aortic lymph nodes. Therefore, 
      chemotherapy was initiated. After first-line (capecitabine with oxaliplatin) and 
      second-line (paclitaxel with ramucirumab) treatments, nivolumab was used as 
      third-line chemotherapy. This treatment showed a strong effect against the tumor. 
      However, following an immune-related adverse effect (irAE) because of nivolumab, 
      the therapy was halted. The irAE was diagnosed with central adrenal insufficiency 
      that was controllable by oral intake of steroids. CPT-11 was started and showed a 
      similarly strong effect to that observed for nivolumab. Eventually, the recurrent 
      tumor lesions became too small to be detected by CT. We discontinued CPT-11 at 
      the request of the patient. Even after discontinuation, no recurrent sites have 
      been observed, allowing us to declare a case of clinical complete response (cCR). 
      In conclusion, even if irAEs occur in a patient, continuing chemotherapy should 
      be considered. However, if cCR is achieved, discontinuation of chemotherapy might 
      be a strategic treatment option.

TI  - A phase II study of docetaxel in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian and peritoneal 
      carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.
PG  - 130-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Docetaxel is an inhibitor of microtubule depolymerization and has 
      demonstrated activity in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer and gynecologic 
      cancer. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted a study of docetaxel in 
      paclitaxel-resistant ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma to determine its activity, 
      and nature and degree of toxicity, in this cohort of patients. METHODS: Patients 
      with platinum- and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma, defined 
      as progression while on or within 6 months of therapy, were eligible if they had 
      measurable disease and had not received more than one chemotherapy regimen. 
      Docetaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) was administered iv over 1 h every 21 days. A 
      prophylactic regimen of oral dexamethasone 8 mg bid was begun 24 h before 
      docetaxel administration and continued for 48 h thereafter. Hepatic function was 
      strictly monitored. RESULTS: Sixty patients were entered and treated with a total 
      of 256 courses, with all 60 evaluable for toxicity and 58 evaluable for response. 
      Responses were observed in 22.4% of patients, with 5.2% achieving complete 
      response and 17.2% achieving partial response (95% CI, 12.5-35.3%). The median 
      duration of response was 2.5 months. The likelihood of observing a response did 
      not appear to be related to the length of the prior paclitaxel-free interval or 
      duration of prior paclitaxel infusions. The principal adverse effect of grade 4 
      neutropenia occurred in 75% of patients. There was one treatment-related death. 
      Dose reductions were required in 36% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel is 
      active in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian and peritoneal cancer but, in view of 
      significant hematologic toxicity, further study is warranted to ascertain its 
      optimal dose and schedule.

TI  - Pegfilgrastim-induced vasculitis of the subclavian and basilar artery complicated 
      by subarachnoid hemorrhage in a breast cancer patient: a case report and review 
      of the literature.
PG  - 155

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pegfilgrastim (PEG) is a sustained-duration pegylated form of 
      filgrastim, a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor agent that is widely used as 
      prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia during chemotherapy. We report the case 
      of a breast cancer patient who developed PEG-induced vasculitis complicated by 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and review the relevant literature. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old woman had undergone surgery for breast cancer and was 
      receiving docetaxel and cyclophosphamide as adjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel 
      75 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2)); on day 4 of treatment, PEG had been 
      administered. On day 14, she was admitted to hospital with fever, general 
      malaise, and neck pain, and her C-reactive protein level was found to be high 
      (12.65 mg/dL). Although infection was initially suspected, antimicrobial 
      treatment was ineffective and other laboratory test results were negative for 
      this. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography on day 22 showed thickened vessel 
      walls in the left subclavian artery, the origin of the common carotid artery, and 
      the thoracoabdominal aorta. On day 26, magnetic resonance imaging of the head to 
      investigate possible causes of headache showed signs consistent with SAH, and 
      magnetic resonance angiography images showed irregularity in the basilar artery 
      wall; the findings of both studies were considered to be due to PEG-induced 
      vasculitis. Once treatment with prednisolone 40 mg/day had started, the wall 
      thickening and irregularity improved. CONCLUSION: Although an uncommon adverse 
      effect, vasculitis affecting vessels of various sizes may be caused by PEG. To 
      the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe a case of 
      G-CSF-induced vasculitis complicated by SAH. In cases of persistent high fever 
      and elevated inflammatory response after PEG administration and in the absence of 
      infection, clinicians should consider the possibility of drug-induced vasculitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib-pembrolizumab combination (LEAP) is an approved therapy in 
      Japan for advanced endometrial cancer, based on the data from the KEYNOTE-775 
      clinical trial. We report a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome 
      (PRES) in a patient who received LEAP therapy for advanced endometrial cancer. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old patient with stage IVB endometrial cancer having 
      rectal metastases, after four cycles of paclitaxel-carboplatin therapy, was found 
      to have increased rectal invasion, peritoneal dissemination, and multiple 
      paraaortic lymph node metastases. She was treated with LEAP therapy and 
      discharged on day 12 without adverse events, except for mild anemia on day 11 of 
      treatment. She was carefully managed in the outpatient department, but on day 18, 
      she was admitted to the emergency department with severely impaired consciousness 
      and generalized seizures. Computed tomography of the head and lumbar tap showed 
      no abnormal findings, and the seizures resolved with anticonvulsant medication 
      alone. Based on a thorough physical examination and findings on magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI), which showed high signal intensity in the left occipital 
      lobe, encephalopathy, rather than encephalitis, was the likely diagnosis. 
      Symptomatic improvement was observed, and pembrolizumab monotherapy was resumed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: If consciousness is impaired during LEAP treatment, it is necessary 
      to differentiate between immunogenic encephalitis caused by pembrolizumab or 
      encephalopathy caused by lenvatinib. MRI and lumbar tap can help in 
      distinguishing between the two and diagnosing the responsible drug.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors have been widely 
      investigated in the last 10 years, with particular attention paid to their 
      adverse effects because of their efficacy in improving cancer patient survival. 
      Previous research primarily focused on the monoclonal anti-vascular endothelial 
      growth factor antibody bevacizumab and its adverse outcomes. Reports show a 
      higher risk of ischemic stroke, one of the most concerning clinically relevant 
      events, after treatment with bevacizumab. However, few studies have examined the 
      relationship between anti-VEGF receptor 2 monoclonal antibody ramucirumab and its 
      adverse events. This article presents the case of a non-small-cell lung cancer 
      patient who experienced a new ischemic stroke after treatment with ramucirumab. 
      The findings suggest that further studies may be necessary to investigate the 
      relationship between ramucirumab and the risk of ischemic stroke.

TI  - Consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel after platinum-based chemotherapy in 
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a preliminary report.
PG  - 20-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of second line chemotherapy for relapsed non small cell 
      lung cancer has been established. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and 
      toxicity of maintenance therapy with docetaxel in patients with non-small cell 
      lung cancer who were stabilized with first line chemotherapy and had good 
      performance status before relapse. The primary objective was to determine 
      one-year survival and the other objectives were evaluation of adverse effects and 
      time to progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with lung cancer 
      were included in this study. All patients were at stage III and IV, without 
      distant metastasis or neuropathy. All patients had been treated with platinum 
      based regimen initially and were responsive or stable with no progression. The 
      patients were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) for a total of 4 cycles repeated 
      every 3 weeks. RESULTS: All patients accomplished 4 chemotherapy cycles and a 
      total of 72 cycles were administered. The mean time of progression free survival 
      (PFS) was 9-10 months and one- year survival (OS) was 94.4% without any 
      significant adverse effect necessitating medical intervention. The mean survival 
      time of patients was 18 (12-20) months. CONCLUSION: Using docetaxel as 
      consolidation chemotherapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer can 
      prolong time to progression of disease and probably patients' survival without 
      significant adverse effects or negative impact on the quality of life.

LID - e17015
AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) targeted therapies, such as 
      trastuzumab emtansine, has been shown to have a significant positive effect on 
      the outcome of breast cancer. Rarely, this therapy can cause adverse 
      cardiovascular effects such as cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias and hypertension. 
      We report a case of a 60-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department 
      with an episode of hypertensive emergency. She had been recently diagnosed with 
      hypertension which was found to be poorly controlled. The recent administration 
      of trastuzumab together with this hypertensive episode led us to suspect 
      trastuzumab as the cause for this rise in her blood pressure. With this case we 
      intend to raise awareness of hypertension, a potentially preventable condition, 
      as an adverse effect of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 targeted 
      therapies such as trastuzumab. Additionally we propose an appropriate and careful 
      management of arterial hypertension among those receiving this first-in-class 
      drug.

TI  - Management of immune-related hepatitis in patients being treated with checkpoint 
      inhibitors for metastatic melanoma, a review and case series.
PG  - 10781552221103548
LID - 10.1177/10781552221103548 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immune-related hepatitis is an adverse effect following treatment 
      with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, nivolumab and 
      pembrolizumab. International guidelines advise on the use of corticosteroids as 
      first-line treatment, although guidance on how to treat cases resistant to 
      corticosteroids is limited. We aimed to evaluate the presentation and management 
      of patients with grade 3-4 immune-related hepatitis, following treatment with 
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors for stage 4 or unresectable or stage 3 melanoma, 
      with a particular focus on steroid-refractory cases. METHODS: A retrospective 
      observational review of patients developing immune-related hepatitis whilst 
      undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced melanoma from 
      July 2014 to February 2020 at a tertiary oncology centre. RESULTS: Forty-one 
      patients developed immune-related hepatitis, of which 83% had been treated with 
      the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab. The median time to onset of 
      IR-hepatitis was 47 days (range: 4-476), and the median time to peak alanine 
      aminotransferase was 71 days (range: 4-478). Four patients had resolution of 
      grade 3 immune-related hepatitis without the introduction of corticosteroids. A 
      total of 37 patients were treated with corticosteroids. A total of 12 required 
      oral treatment only and 13 were successfully managed as outpatients. Six patients 
      had steroid-refractory immune-related hepatitis; and all received tacrolimus, 
      with one also receiving mycophenolate mofetil and infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study describes the largest UK series of immune-related hepatitis patients in the 
      literature. We present two important deviations from current guidelines. Firstly, 
      there is some evidence that withholding steroids is possible in grade 3-4 
      immune-related hepatitis. Secondly, tacrolimus can be used successfully to manage 
      patients resistant to corticosteroids, with the early introduction most 
      beneficial to reduce time on steroids.

TI  - Second-line treatment strategy for urothelial cancer patients who progress or are 
      unfit for cisplatin therapy: a network meta-analysis.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.1186/s12894-019-0560-7 [doi]
LID - 125
AB  - BACKGROUND: Second-line treatment for urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients is used 
      if progression or failure after platinum-based chemotherapy occurs or if patients 
      are cisplatin-unfit. However, there is still no widely accepted treatment 
      strategy. We aimed to analyze the effectiveness and safety of second-line 
      treatment strategies for UC patients. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane 
      databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included UC 
      patients who were cisplatin-ineligible or unfit up to April 19, 2019. The primary 
      outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and 
      objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Thirteen trials that assessed 3502 UC 
      patients were included. This study divided the network comparisons into three 
      parts. The first part contained studies comparing taxanes and other 
      interventions; the second part assessed investigator's choice chemotherapy 
      (ICC)-related comparisons; and the third part assessed best support care (BSC). 
      In the OS results of the first part, pembrolizumab (87.5%), ramucirumab plus 
      docetaxel (74.6%), and atezolizumab (71.1%) had a relative advantage. 
      Pembrolizumab also had advantages in ORR and severe adverse effect (SAE) results. 
      Vinflunine and ramucirumab plus docetaxel had a relatively high surface under the 
      cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) rank by exploratory cluster analysis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that atezolizumab and pembrolizumab are 
      superior to other treatments, mainly in OS results, but no treatment confers a 
      significant advantage in PFS. Pembrolizumab still has relative advantages in ORR 
      and SAE results compared to ICC. Due to limitations, more studies are necessary 
      to confirm the conclusions.

      carcinoma.
PG  - 1806-1809
LID - 10.1177/10781552211032722 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Salivary gland neoplasms (SGNs) respond poorly to the traditional 
      chemotherapy agents limiting the availability of systemic treatment options in 
      the metastatic setting. The recent identification of actionable molecular targets 
      in SGNs has led to the evaluation of targeted therapies in non-approved advanced 
      SGNs. CASE REPORT: We present the case of an elderly male with HER-2 Neu 
      overexpressing metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) who demonstrated a 
      prompt and sustained disease response to targeted therapies directed against 
      HER-2 Neu with long survival interrupted by hepatoxicity to Trastuzumab emtansine 
      (TDM-1) treatment.Management and Outcome: The patient was started on Trastuzumab 
      and Pertuzumab on a clinical trial and resulted in an objective improvement 
      sustained over 3 years. Following the disease progression, TDM-1 was started with 
      a response until the patient developed severe hepatotoxicity as an adverse effect 
      of TDM-1 therapy resulting in its discontinuation. Close follow-up 
      post-treatment-discontinuation demonstrated continued clinical improvement until 
      6 months, when the patient developed brain metastasis. He passed away a few 
      months later in hospice care. DISCUSSION: The metastatic MEC in our patient 
      overexpressed HER-2 Neu. Owing to Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab response, 
      Trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) was initiated on a compassionate basis which 
      further extended the survival but had to be terminated owing to adverse effects. 
      Given the paucity of data on targeted therapies in the treatment of metastatic 
      SGNs and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TDM-1 therapy among the 
      elderly, further studies are warranted to answer these important questions and to 
      identify eligible patients for this novel treatment option.

AB  - A 57-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma was treated with chemotherapy and 
      immune checkpoint blockade. After two cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and 
      pembrolizumab, he developed a persistent fever. Chest computed tomography (CT) 
      suggested inflammation of the aortic wall. We treated the patient with 
      corticosteroids. After four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab, 
      chest CT showed an aneurysm in the ascending aorta. We diagnosed him with 
      inflammatory thoracic aortic aneurysm induced by pembrolizumab and performed 
      surgical replacement of the ascending aorta. Although this might be a very rare 
      case, we should be aware of aortitis as a potential adverse effect of 
      pembrolizumab.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Cancer immunotherapy is evolving rapidly and is transforming 
      cancer care. During the last decade, immune checkpoint therapies have been 
      developed to enhance the immune response; however, specific adverse effects 
      related to autoimmunity are increasingly apparent. This study aims to fill the 
      knowledge gap related to the spectrum of immune-related adverse effects among 
      cancer patients visiting emergency departments (EDs). METHODS: We performed a 
      retrospective review of patients treated with immune checkpoint therapy who 
      visited the ED of a comprehensive cancer center between March 1, 2011, and 
      February 29, 2016. Immune-related adverse effects from the ED visits were 
      identified and profiled. We analyzed the association of each immune-related 
      adverse effect with overall survival from the ED visit to death. RESULTS: We 
      identified 1,026 visits for 628 unique patients; of these, 257 visits (25.0%) 
      were related to one or more immune-related adverse effects. Diarrhea was the most 
      common one leading to an ED visit. The proportions of ED visits associated 
      with diarrhea, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, or hepatitis varied 
      significantly by immune checkpoint therapy agent. Colitis was significantly 
      associated with better prognosis, whereas pneumonitis was significantly 
      associated with worse survival. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients treated with 
      ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab may have a spectrum of immune-related 
      adverse effects that require emergency care. Future studies will need to update 
      this profile as further novel immunotherapeutic agents are added.

TI  - Surgical treatment of canalicular stenosis in patients receiving docetaxel 
      weekly.
PG  - 1802-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical treatment and outcomes in patients with 
      metastatic breast cancer and canalicular stenosis caused by weekly treatment with 
      docetaxel. METHODS: This case series included 10 patients with persistent 
      epiphora due to weekly docetaxel treatment, who were evaluated by probing and 
      irrigation of the tear drainage apparatus and were found to have significant 
      canalicular stenosis. The severity of canalicular stenosis was graded clinically. 
      Each patient underwent bicanalicular silicone intubation or dacryocystorhinostomy 
      (DCR) with placement of either a silicone tube (canaliculo DCR) or a pyrex glass 
      tube (conjunctivo DCR). RESULTS: Seven patients (12 eyes) underwent bicanalicular 
      silicone intubation. Three patients (5 eyes) required canaliculo DCR with the 
      placement of a silicone tube. In 2 patients (3 eyes), the degree of canalicular 
      stenosis was severe enough to require conjunctivo DCR with the placement of a 
      pyrex glass tube. All 10 patients had complete resolution of epiphora immediately 
      after surgery. Four patients continued to receive docetaxel after surgery. In 
      patients who underwent bicanalicular silicone intubation, the silicone stent was 
      kept in place for the duration of docetaxel therapy. There were no surgical or 
      anesthesia-related complications. At a mean follow-up time of 9 months after 
      surgery, all but 1 patient (1 eye) remained asymptomatic. The interval between 
      initiation of docetaxel therapy and surgery was significantly higher in patients 
      who required DCR compared with those who had silicone intubation. The mean 
      cumulative dose of docetaxel at the time of surgery was higher in patients who 
      required DCR than in patients who had silicone intubation, but this difference 
      was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Canalicular stenosis secondary to 
      weekly treatment with docetaxel should be treated with bicanalicular silicone 
      intubation early in the course of docetaxel therapy. Failure to treat this 
      adverse effect early may likely lead to severe and irreversible canalicular 
      stenosis, which may necessitate conjunctivo DCR with the placement of a permanent 
      pyrex glass tube.

TI  - Targeting the androgen receptor (AR) with AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9® led to 
      increase docetaxel sensitivity via suppressing the p21 expression.

AB  - Chemotherapy with docetaxel remains the effective therapy to suppress castration 
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in some patients. However, most chemotherapy 
      with docetaxel eventually fails with the development of docetaxel resistance 
      after 18-weeks of treatment. Here we found docetaxel treatment might have an 
      adverse effect of increasing the androgen receptor (AR) protein level in the CRPC 
      cells, and combining docetaxel with anti-AR therapy using AR-shRNA or the AR 
      degradation enhancer ASC-J9® may increase docetaxel sensitivity to better 
      suppress the CRPC cell growth. Mechanism dissection found docetaxel might have 
      the adverse effect of increasing the AR protein stability via suppressing the AR 
      ubiquitination due to the increased AR phosphorylation. The consequence of such 
      increased AR protein may then lead to increase p21 expression via transcriptional 
      regulation. Preclinical studies with in vitro cells lines also demonstrated that 
      targeting AR with ASC-J9® led to suppressing the AR-increased p21 expression to 
      improve the docetaxel sensitivity in the CRPC cells that already developed 
      docetaxel resistance. Together, these results suggest that a combined therapy of 
      docetaxel and ASC-J9® is a novel therapy to better suppress CRPC in patients that 
      already developed docetaxel resistance.

TI  - Incidence of breast lymphedema and predictors of its development in patients 
      receiving whole breast radiation therapy after breast-conservation surgery.
PG  - 126-133
AB  - One common adverse effect following breast-conservation surgery and adjuvant 
      radiation is lymphedema. While lymphedema of the arm has been well-characterized, 
      there has been less investigation into lymphedema of the breast. We sought to 
      characterize rates of breast lymphedema (BLE) in women with early-stage breast 
      cancer and identify potential predictors in its development. Two hundred and 
      thirty consecutive patients treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant whole breast 
      radiation therapy (WBRT) from January 2016 - June 2017 were included. All 
      patients were seen in our lymphedema monitoring clinic for baseline and at least 
      one follow-up lymphedema measurement. BLE grades were assigned by trained nurses 
      in the lymphedema clinic. Data regarding patient demographic and treatment 
      factors were extracted from the electronic medical record. Comparisons between 
      groups were made using Chi-Square analysis performed in SAS. The median age of 
      the sample was 62 (range 31-90). Median follow-up from surgery was 15.3 months. 
      Forty-three patients were diagnosed with lymphedema of the breast (18.7%). Rates 
      of grade 1 and 2 BLE were 93% and 7%, respectively; there were no cases of severe 
      lymphedema. Sixty-three percent of cases resolved by last follow-up with 
      treatment recommendations. There was no association between development of BLE 
      and patient factors investigated, including age, T stage, radiation dose and 
      fractionation, lymph node biopsy, number of lymph nodes removed, development of 
      arm lymphedema, and use of chemotherapy. Tumor subtype was found to be 
      significant (P = 0.04) and there was a trend towards significance for receipt of 
      trastuzumab (P = 0.09). BLE is a distinct entity from arm lymphedema and is a 
      common finding in women treated with breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant WBRT.

TI  - Assessment of HER-2/neu overexpression and/or gene amplification in breast 
      carcinomas: should in situ hybridization be the method of choice?
PG  - 444-50
AB  - AIMS: Since the release of Herceptin, pathology laboratories have been requested 
      to test breast carcinomas for HER-2/neu overexpression and/or gene amplification. 
      Standardized IHC and FISH are mandatory in order to get reliable results, but 
      there are problems even with standardized procedures. We decided to evaluate the 
      two methods to determine which, or possibly if both, should be the primary 
      investigation method(s). METHODS AND RESULTS: The material consisted of 215 
      primary invasive breast carcinomas with complete clinical follow-up of 15 years. 
      HER-2/neu protein expression was determined for all specimens, whereas FISH for 
      assessing HER-2/neu gene signal number was done in 165 cases. IHC was 
      double-checked with two or three different antibodies in 35 tumours, including 
      all cases with discrepancies between IHC and FISH. Among these, there were 
      discrepancies in a third. IHC overexpression of HER-2/neu was found in 13% and 
      gene amplification in 18%. Discordance between IHC and FISH was found in 11 cases 
      (8%). Five tumours were IHC+/FISH- and six were IHC-/FISH+. IHC and FISH positive 
      cases as well as FISH only positive tumours had the same prognosis respecting 
      survival. Tumours with >2 but <or=4 HER-2 gene signals per nucleus had the same 
      survival as cases with >4 gene signals per nucleus. In contrast, cases with IHC 
      overexpression without gene amplification had a prognosis similar to that of 
      IHC-/FISH- tumours. CONCLUSIONS: From our data, it seems to be more important to 
      assess HER-2/neu gene amplification than IHC overexpression. Failure to detect 
      FISH-amplified (IHC-negative) cases would have an adverse effect on the survival 
      of these patients. On the other hand, IHC overexpression tumours without gene 
      amplification appear to belong to a better prognostic group, and failure to 
      detect them would probably not have a negative effect on the survival of these 
      women. Even though FISH is a more complex and expensive procedure, it should be 
      considered the method of choice for primary assessment of HER-2/neu status in 
      breast cancer patients.

AB  - Pembrolizumab is a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for use in 
      non-small cell lung carcinoma. There have been a few cases that have associated 
      adverse renal outcomes with pembrolizumab. We present a case of acute kidney 
      injury in a patient on pembrolizumab who was noted to have acute 
      tubulointerstitial nephritis on renal biopsy. Pembrolizumab was discontinued and 
      the patient was started on long-term corticosteroids with a taper. Her renal 
      function improved partially with treatment.

TI  - Pembrolizumab-Induced Immune-Mediated Colitis in a Patient with Concurrent 
      Clostridium Difficile Infection.
PG  - 164-170
LID - 10.1159/000497155 [doi]
AB  - Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor that has been 
      approved for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. Immune-mediated colitis 
      is a known but uncommon adverse effect of pembrolizumab. Symptoms of 
      immune-mediated colitis can be similar to those of many other gastrointestinal 
      illnesses, including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). If not recognized and 
      treated in a timely fashion, immune-mediated colitis can lead to significant 
      morbidity in cancer patients. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman on 
      pembrolizumab for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented 
      with severe colitis symptoms and initially tested positive for CDI. Her colitis 
      symptoms worsened despite appropriate treatment for CDI but later improved 
      rapidly after systemic corticosteroid was started for suspected immune-mediated 
      colitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of concurrent 
      pembrolizumab-induced colitis and CDI. Immune-mediated colitis should be 
      considered in the differential diagnoses in patients on pembrolizumab or other 
      immune checkpoint inhibitors who present with colitis symptoms, even when a 
      concurrent infectious etiology is suspected.

AB  - Immunotherapy is a biological therapy that helps the body's immune system to 
      fight against cancer cells. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the 
      first immune checkpoint inhibitor in 2011. Since 2011, many immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors have been approved. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors are now 
      commonly used in multiple malignancies due to their remarkable response. Thus, 
      immune-related adverse events are now coming into the limelight due to the 
      increasing use of PD-1 inhibitors. Here, we present a case of a 54-year-old 
      female with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab and 
      later presented with severe neurotoxicity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of 
      pemetrexed+cisplatin (PP) versus docetaxel+cisplatin (DP) for the treatment of 
      stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 
      147 patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma treated between January 2011 and 
      December 2015, 100 of which were in the DP group whereas 47 were in the DP group. 
      Main inclusion criteria were treatment-naive patients, first-line treatment with 
      PP or DP with no molecular targeted therapy during treatment, 2-6 cycles of 
      first-line chemotherapy with unknown status of epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (EGFR) mutation, 18-75 years of age, and Karnofsky performance status score of at 
      least 70. Prognostic factors for survival were identified by using univariate and 
      multivariate analyses. Propensity score matching was performed to further adjust 
      for confounding. A total of 47 pairs were successfully matched between the two 
      groups. The median overall survival was 9.0 months in the DP group and 17.0 
      months in the PP group; the 1-year survival rate was 29.8 and 59.6%, 
      respectively; the 2-year survival rate was 12.8 and 21.1%, respectively (χ=4.128, 
      P=0.042); and median progression-free survival was 6.0 and 8.0 months, 
      respectively (χ=4.839, P=0.028). Cox multivariate analysis showed that 
      chemotherapy regimen and number of metastatic organs were independent factors for 
      OS. The effect of the radiotherapy dose on the primary tumor on OS was close to 
      statistically significant. The incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia was more 
      significantly reduced in the DP group than in the PP group after matching (61.7 
      vs. 27.7%, P=0.002), with no between-group difference for adverse effects on 
      platelets or hemoglobin. For patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma and 
      unknown EGFR mutation status, PP was more effective than DP in prolonging 
      survival and had a less adverse effect on neutrophils.

TI  - Evaluation of the association of PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss with efficacy of 
      trastuzumab therapy in metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 447-56

AB  - Trastuzumab (T) is effective in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with HER2 
      overexpression and/or amplification, but resistance to T develops in a 
      significant number of HER2-positive patients. Understanding the mechanisms of 
      resistance is critical to the care of these patients. Formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from 256 patients with 
      T-treated MBC. Clinical information was collected retrospectively from the 
      patients' medical records. Central review of HER2 status by fluorescent in situ 
      hybridization (FISH) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that of the 227 
      eligible patients only 139 (61%) were truly HER2-positive. PTEN, ER, PgR, and 
      Ki67 were evaluated by IHC, while PTEN status was evaluated by FISH as well. 
      PIK3CA mutations were identified with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      genotyping. Median time to progression (TTP) was 14.4 months for the 
      HER2-positive and 10.3 for the HER2-negative patients (log-rank, P = 0.22). 
      Survival from the initiation of T (survivalT) was 50.4 months for the 
      HER2-positive and 35.3 for the HER2-negative subgroups (P = 0.006). Higher risk 
      of progression was associated with HER2-positive status and the presence of 
      PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.014). PTEN loss, as determined by IHC, was associated 
      with lower survivalT in the whole population (P = 0.029) and in the HER2-positive 
      population (P = 0.017). PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss status were evaluated 
      together as a single parameter, to estimate the impact of activation of the 
      PI3K/AKT molecular pathway, and it was significantly associated with both 
      decreased TTP (P = 0.003 in the total population, P = 0.004 in HER2-positive 
      patients) and survival (survivalT, P = 0.011 in total, P = 0.006 in 
      HER2-positive). In this trastuzumab-treated breast cancer population, PIK3CA 
      activating mutations were associated with shorter TTP and PTEN loss with 
      decreased survival. The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway from either defect was 
      associated with both TTP and survival, indicating the adverse effect of this 
      pathway's status on trastuzumab efficacy.

TI  - Treatment with Ramucirumab-paclitaxel in a metastatic gastric cancer patient 
      undergoing hemodialysis: A case report.
PG  - e24795
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000024795 [doi]
LID - e24795
AB  - RATIONALE: Ramucirumab, a human Ig 1 monoclonal antibody against vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor-2, in combination with paclitaxel is a 
      second-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Several 
      reports have suggested that dose adjustments of cetuximab, an anti- epidermal 
      growth factor receptor antibody, are not required in patients with renal 
      impairment. However, the combination chemotherapy of ramucirumab and cytotoxic 
      drug for hemodialysis (HD) patients has not been reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 
      65-year-old man on HD was diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent a subtotal 
      gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was 
      examined after completion of 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine 
      combination oxaliplatin. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with advanced 
      gastric cancer at stage IIIb (pT3N2M0) 11 months ago. Unfortunately, 9 months 
      after the start of adjuvant chemotherapy, multiple liver metastases from gastric 
      cancer were found by abdominal CT. INTERVENTIONS: He began receiving weekly 
      paclitaxel(80 mg/m2) and every 15-day ramucirumab (8 mg/kg). HD was performed 
      next day after administration of chemotherapy and repeated 3 times a week. 
      OUTCOMES: He was treated with ramucirumab without dose adjustment. The metastatic 
      liver mass had a partial response, after 2 and 4 cycles of chemotherapy and had a 
      stable disease up to 12 cycles of chemotherapy. No obvious adverse effect was 
      observed during treatment. However, after 14 cycles chemotherapy, follow-up 
      abdominal CT revealed progression disease of multiple liver metastasis and lymph 
      nodes invasion. LESSONS: The paclitaxel chemotherapy with ramucirumab is 
      effective and safe in HD patients with metastatic gastric cancer. As seen in 
      patients with normal kidney function, ramucirumab can be safely administered 
      without a dose reduction.

LID - 10.2217/imt-2020-0332 [doi]
AB  - Capillary-leak syndrome is strongly associated with cytokine activity states. It 
      is an ill-recognized adverse effect of checkpoint inhibitors treatment, which are 
      typically associated with cellular immune response. We describe two patients with 
      capillary leak syndrome following immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment. We 
      present linking mechanisms between checkpoint inhibitors, cellular immunity, 
      cytokine action and endothelial damage. We suggest that capillary-leak syndrome 
      is a unique adverse effect of immunotherapy, resulting from complex interactions 
      between cellular and cytokine activation and that its expression is probably 
      depending on inherent host immune variabilities.

OAB - Lay abstract Modern cancer treatment increasingly relies on means that encourage 
      the patient's immune system to attack and destroy existing cancer cells. These 
      means are very effective compared with standard treatments. However, the 
      activation of the immune system is sometimes associated with untoward effects as 
      a result of an attack of bystanding healthy tissues by the overactivated immune 
      system and excessive inflammatory processes that accompany the immune response. 
      We describe here two patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibiting drugs 
      that developed transient extensive edema attributed to leakage of serum proteins 
      and water from small blood vessels into the surrounding tissues (so-called 
      ‘capillary-leak syndrome’), after the drug-induced activation of the immune 
      system. In both patients, the edema subsided following specific interventions.

TI  - The Elental(®) elemental diet for chemoradiotherapy-induced oral mucositis: A 
      prospective study in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 159-167
LID - 10.3892/mco.2018.1769 [doi]
AB  - Oral mucositis is a common adverse effect of cancer treatment that can increase 
      the risk for local and systemic infection. This prospective study was designed to 
      evaluate the preventive effects of an amino-acid-rich elemental diet (ED), 
      Elental(®), on radiotherapy- or chemoradiotherapy-induced mucositis in oral 
      squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. Fifty patients were enrolled in this 
      prospective study, who had received radiation (60-70 Gy) with/without 
      chemotherapy [S-1, UFT, cisplatin (CDDP), docetaxel (DOC) plus CDDP, or 
      Cetuximab]. The Elental(®) group (25 patients) had received Elental(®) during 
      treatment, and the control group (25 patients) had not. Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis was used to identify the factors related to abatement of oral 
      mucositis. A comparison of the rates of completion of chemoradiation treatments 
      as well as the nutritional or inflammatory status between Elental(®) and control 
      groups was performed. Multivariate analysis indicated that most of the patients 
      who received Elental(®) suffered from a lower degree of mucositis and showed 
      significantly improved rate of completion of chemoradiation (no interruption) 
      compared to the control group. There was a significant difference between the 
      Elental(®) group and the control group in terms of the mean change of C-reactive 
      protein (CRP) levels in blood serum; however, there was no significant difference 
      in terms of a mean change of body weight and total protein level in blood serum 
      before and after chemoradiation. Our study shows that the Elental(®) elemental 
      diet could be useful for the treatment of oral mucositis induced by 
      chemoradiation. Elental(®) might also promote improved completion rates of 
      chemoradiotherapy in OSCC patients.

TI  - Ado-trastuzumab emtansine-associated telangiectasias in metastatic breast cancer: 
      a case series.
PG  - 451-6
LID - 10.1007/s10549-014-3001-z [doi]
AB  - Treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with ado-trastuzumab 
      emtansine (T-DM1), a novel antibody-drug conjugate, has resulted in both improved 
      progression-free and overall survival. Recognition and treatment of diverse 
      adverse events related to T-DM1 is critical for safety and tolerability. The most 
      frequent adverse events with T-DM1 include fatigue, diarrhea, anemia, elevated 
      transaminases, and mild-to-moderate hemorrhagic events, which are thought to be 
      related to induced thrombocytopenia. Here, we present five case series of 
      cutaneous and mucosal telangiectasias, definitely related to T-DM1. The 
      development of telangiectasias represents a newly recognized adverse effect of 
      T-DM1. We provide description and timing of the telangiectasias and review the 
      mechanisms that may explain the formation of these vascular lesions in 
      association with T-DM1. Further, we describe associated bleeding events and 
      propose that induced telangiectasias could represent an additional cause of 
      T-DM1-associated hemorrhage.

TI  - Cytokine release syndrome and successful response to pembrolizumab therapy in a 
      patient with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer: A case report.
PG  - 1419-1422
LID - 10.1111/1759-7714.14390 [doi]
AB  - A therapeutic option for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
      with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
      resistance is a clinical challenge. The clinical outcomes of pembrolizumab in 
      those patients is inconclusive. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a rarely 
      reported immune-related adverse event in the field of immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors therapy, raising challenges given the paucity of data with such 
      presentations. We present the unique case of a 67-year-old female with advanced 
      EGFR-mutated NSCLC who successfully responded to pembrolizumab after EGFR-TKI 
      resistance. However, the patient developed CRS after pembrolizumab initiation and 
      presented with fever, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and multiple 
      organ dysfunction. Blood tests showed elevated levels of peripheral CD8+ T cells, 
      C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-α. The symptoms rapidly improved 
      after corticosteroid initiation. Based on the present case, we propose that 
      pembrolizumab might be a potential salvage therapy for patients with advanced 
      EGFR-mutated NSCLC after EGFR-TKI resistance; CRS would be a sign of the 
      antitumor effect of PD-1 inhibitors in those patients. However, CRS can be a 
      fatal adverse effect and clinicians must remain vigilant for the rare toxicities 
      to make prompt diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Clinical Utility of Routine Cardiac Monitoring in Breast Cancer Patients 
      Receiving Trastuzumab.
PG  - 712-7
LID - 10.1177/1060028016654160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 
      (HER2). Cardiotoxicity is a potential adverse effect, manifesting as either an 
      asymptomatic decline in left-ventricular ejection fraction or infrequently as 
      largely reversible symptomatic heart failure (HF). Monitoring recommendations 
      differ between product labeling and 2012 guidelines, and the clinical utility of 
      serial cardiac monitoring in patients with metastatic breast cancer remains 
      controversial. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to describe the 
      frequency of monitoring, incidence of symptomatic or asymptomatic HF, overall 
      effect on treatment, and cost of monitoring for cardiotoxicity. METHODS: We 
      preformed an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of 
      breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab from January 1, 2009, through 
      January 1, 2014, at an academic medical center. RESULTS: Out of 154 treatments, 
      72% were adjuvant, and 28% were metastatic. In the adjuvant setting, a mean of 
      4.5 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4-5) echocardiograms (echos) over a mean of 11.5 
      (IQR = 11-12) months were performed. In the metastatic setting, a mean of 3.1 
      (IQR = 1-5) echos over a mean of 20.2 (IQR = 9-31) months were performed. 
      Symptomatic HF events occurred in 4 adjuvant (3.6%) and 2 metastatic patients 
      (6.5%); 10 patients (6.5%) had a treatment interruption, with 9 (90%) tolerating 
      restart of trastuzumab. Two patients (1.3%) changed treatment as a result of 
      cardiotoxicity. Using population incidence of HER2-positive breast cancer, $13 
      million could be saved if monitoring were reduced by 1 echo per patient. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the low incidence of clinically significant HF and cost of 
      monitoring, less frequent monitoring may be justified.

TI  - Gastroparesis Following Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy: A Case Series.
PG  - 1974-1980
LID - 10.1007/s10620-020-06440-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved outcomes in patients 
      with various malignancies; however, they can cause immune-related hepatitis and 
      enterocolitis. Patients on ICI may also develop upper gastrointestinal symptoms 
      and undergo measurement of gastric emptying. AIMS: Our aim was to review records 
      of patients with gastroparesis following ICI therapy at two medical centers. 
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients at Mayo Clinic and 
      Brigham and Women's/Dana-Farber Cancer Center (BWH/DFCC) who underwent gastric 
      scintigraphy for the assessment of symptoms of gastroparesis following ICI 
      treatment up to January 2020. Clinical presentation, medical history, laboratory 
      evaluation, imaging, treatment, and outcomes were retrieved from the records. 
      Gastroparesis was diagnosed as delayed gastric emptying (GE) measured by gastric 
      scintigraphy. RESULTS: At Mayo Clinic, 2 patients (median age 59 years, 1 male 
      [M], 1 female [F]) had delayed GE, while 4 patients (median age 53 years, 3M, 1F) 
      had normal GE following ICI use. Of those with delayed GE (diagnosed after 38 and 
      2 months of ICI initiation), 1 patient was treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 
      melanoma with ipilimumab; a second patient with breast cancer was treated with 
      pembrolizumab. At BWH/DFCC, 2 patients (median age 56 years, 1M, 1F) had normal 
      GE after ICI treatment, while a 62-year-old female with non-small cell lung 
      cancer developed gastroparesis 3 months following initiation of nivolumab. 
      CONCLUSION: This report documents gastroparesis as a potential adverse effect of 
      ICI. Further studies should explore the potential for ICI therapy to damage 
      anti-inflammatory macrophages that preserve the enteric neurons.

TI  - Randomized phase II study of bortezomib alone and bortezomib in combination with 
      docetaxel in previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
PG  - 5025-33
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of bortezomib +/- docetaxel as 
      second-line therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced 
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly 
      assigned to bortezomib 1.5 mg/m2 (arm A) or bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 plus docetaxel 
      75 mg/m2 (arm B). A treatment cycle of 21 days comprised four bortezomib doses on 
      days 1, 4, 8, and 11, plus, in arm B, docetaxel on day 1. Patients could receive 
      unlimited cycles. The primary end point was response rate. RESULTS: A total of 
      155 patients were treated, 75 in arm A and 80 in arm B. Baseline characteristics 
      were comparable. Investigator-assessed response rates were 8% in arm A and 9% in 
      arm B. Disease control rates were 29% in arm A and 54% in arm B. Median time to 
      progression was 1.5 months in arm A and 4.0 months in arm B. One-year survival 
      was 39% and 33%, and median survival was 7.4 and 7.8 months in arms A and B, 
      respectively. Adverse effect profiles were as expected in both arms, with no 
      significant additivity. The most common grade > or = 3 adverse events were 
      neutropenia, fatigue, and dyspnea (4% and 53%, 19% and 26%, and 17% and 14% of 
      patients in arms A and B, respectively). CONCLUSION: Bortezomib has modest 
      single-agent activity in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced NSCLC 
      using this schedule, with minor enhancement in combination with docetaxel. 
      Additional investigation of bortezomib in NSCLC is warranted in combination with 
      other drugs known to be active, or using different schedules.

AB  - Docetaxel-associated palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia is rarely reported in 
      literature, particularly when used in the treatment of sarcomas. Here, we report 
      a case of docetaxel-related palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia in a 28-year-old 
      male with recurrent Ewing sarcoma. Although palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia has 
      been seen in the literature for 30 years, there has still been little progress in 
      understanding and appropriately addressing this adverse effect. This case report 
      and literature review illustrates an infrequently documented adverse skin 
      reaction and discusses the etiology, presentation, and available treatment 
      options for palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.

AB  - The humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has been in routine use for 
      chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor II (HER2)-positive breast 
      cancer. A major adverse effect of trastuzumab is cardiotoxicity. Well-established 
      biomarkers or echocardiographic parameters to predict trastuzumab-induced 
      cardiotoxicity have not yet been determined. We attempted to identify useful 
      biomarkers and/or echocardiographic parameters to predict trastuzumab-induced 
      cardiotoxicity. We prospectively investigated the cases of 19 women who received 
      chemotherapy including anthracyclines and trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast 
      cancer. We measured cardiac biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters before 
      their chemotherapy and every 3 months up to 15 months until the end of the 
      adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. We divided the patients into two groups: group R 
      was the nine patients who showed a reduction of left ventricular ejection 
      fraction (LVEF) ≥5%, and group N was the 10 patients who showed a reduction of 
      LVEF <5%. The high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) level at 6 months was 
      significantly higher in group R than in group N (11.0 ± 7.8 pg/mL vs. 
      4.0 ± 1.4 pg/mL, p < 0.01). The hs-TnT level with a cutoff value of 5.5 pg/mL at 
      6 months had 78% sensitivity and 80% specificity for predicting a reduction of 
      LVEF at 15 months. In our evaluation of echocardiographic parameters at baseline, 
      the diastolic function was more impaired in group R than in group N. The hs-TnT 
      and echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function could be useful to predict 
      trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.

TI  - Oral mucositis. Is it present in the immunotherapy of the immune checkpoint 
      pd1/pd-l1 against oral cancer? A systematic review.
PG  - e494-e501
LID - 10.4317/medoral.24353 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis (OM) is a painful lesion that takes place in the 
      mucosa of the oral cavity, usually its etiology is associated with drug therapies 
      in cancer patients. It is presented as well-defined ulcers whose painful 
      symptomatology sometimes implies the suspension of oncological treatment or 
      parenteral feeding, being therefore an important adverse effect, marking the 
      evolution of these types of therapies against cancer. The present work aim is to 
      know the prevalence of oral mucositis in oral cancer immunotherapy compared to 
      its prevalence in standard therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A protocol was 
      developed for a systematic review following PRISMA® guidelines and a focused 
      question (PICO) was constructed. A comprehensive literature search was conducted 
      on electronic databases including PubMed, the SCOPUS database, the Cochrane 
      library and the Web of Science (WOS). RESULTS: Six clinical trials were included 
      that met the different inclusion criteria. In these articles, a discrepancy 
      between the prevalence of OM in patients treated with chemotherapy and patients 
      treated with immunotherapy related to the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 (Nivolumab 
      and Pembrolizumab) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of oral mucositis is 
      lower in new immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against oral cancer than 
      drugs used so far (chemotherapy drugs [methotrexate, cisplatin] as well as 
      cetuximab). However, more studies should be carried out to confirm these data.

TI  - Applicability of Traditional In Vitro Toxicity Tests for Assessing Adverse 
      Effects of Monoclonal Antibodies: A Case Study of Rituximab and Trastuzumab.
LID - 10.3390/antib7030030 [doi]
LID - 30
AB  - Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have a promising outlook within the 
      pharmaceutical industry having made positive strides in both research and 
      development as well as commercialisation, however this development has been 
      hampered by manufacturing failures and attrition. This study explores the 
      applicability of traditional in vitro toxicity tests for detecting any off-target 
      adverse effect elicited by mAbs on specific organ systems using hepatocarcinoma 
      cell line (HepG2) and human dermal fibroblasts neonatal (HDFn), respectively. The 
      mechanism of antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent 
      cytotoxicity (CDC) via complement activation, and complement dependent cellular 
      cytotoxicity (CDCC) were assessed. Major results: no apparent ADCC, CDCC, or CDC 
      mediated decrease in cell viability was measured for HepG2 cells. For HDFn cells, 
      though ADCC or CDCC mediated decreases in cell viability wasn't detected, a CDC 
      mediated decrease in cell viability was observed. Several considerations have 
      been elucidated for development of in vitro assays better suited to detect off 
      target toxicity of mAbs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-PD-1 therapies, have 
      prolonged overall survival in patients with a variety of cancers, and 
      immunotherapy is sometimes associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs); 
      however, hematological toxicity, especially neutropenia, is rare. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old man with squamous lung cancer, with brain metastasis, 
      was treated with pembrolizumab and albumin-bound paclitaxel as first-line 
      treatment for one cycle and changed to pembrolizumab plus anlotinib at the second 
      cycle. After two therapy cycles, grade 4 neutropenia developed, which mainly 
      contributed to irAEs. The patient was started on granulocyte colony-stimulating 
      factor (G-CSF) but did not improve; he was then treated with corticosteroids, and 
      neutrophil counts gradually returned to normal levels. However, the patient 
      eventually died because of neurological problems. CONCLUSION: Grade 4 neutropenia 
      associated with ICI, although rare, is often severe and presents with infectious 
      complications; it needs to be diagnosed early, and clinicians should ensure 
      prompt and proper management to such patients.

AB  - Gastric cancer is the fourth common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer 
      death worldwide. Due to lack of adequate information on the side effects of 
      chemotherapy regimens in treatment of gastric cancer, this study was aimed to 
      determine the side effects of two common chemotherapy regimens of gastric cancer. 
      This prospective study was conducted in Emam Khomeini Educational Hospital and 
      Touba Polyclinic; both are affiliated to Mazandaran University of Medical 
      Sciences. The frequency and severity of side effects of chemotherapy were 
      recorded based on the National Cancer Institution (NCI) Toxicity Criteria 
      (version 2). DCF (Docetaxel, Cisplatin, 5FU) and FOLFOX (Folinic acid, 5FU, 
      Oxaliplatin) adverse reactions were compared using SPSS 16 software. One hundred 
      twenty five chemotherapy cycles administered to seventy four patients were 
      assessed. The most common used regimens were DCF (70%) and FOLFOX (16%). The 
      incidence of vomiting was higher with DCF compared to FOLFOX (P = 0.049). In more 
      than 50% of cycles, DCF regimen caused diarrhea, while in FOLFOX regimen it was 
      less than 9% (P = 0.002). Stomatitis, visual changes, nausea, skin reactions, and 
      constipation were not significantly different between the two regimens. It seems 
      that the adverse drug reactions of FOLFOX regimen were more favorable than DCF 
      regimen. The results of this study may help clinicians choosing a more favorable 
      chemotherapy regimen especially in patients with a low performance status who 
      have difficulties in tolerating a chemotherapy regimen with a more severe adverse 
      effect profile.

PG  - E9-E12
AB  - Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors such as 
      nivolumab and pembrolizumab are increasingly used to treat advanced malignancies 
      such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial cancer, and renal cell 
      carcinoma. A rare but increasingly reported adverse effect of anti-PD1 therapy is 
      bullous pemphigoid (BP), an autoimmune blistering disease directed against BP 
      antigen 1 and BP antigen 2 in the basement membrane of the epidermis. We present 
      3 cases of BP secondary to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma and 
      non-small cell lung cancer to highlight the diagnosis and treatment of this 
      condition and emphasize the importance of the dermatologist in the care of 
      patients with immunotherapy-related skin disease.

TI  - Pneumocystis Pneumonia Infection Following the Initiation of Pembrolizumab 
      Therapy for Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Case Report.
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.1163-22 [doi]
AB  - Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic infection that presents a 
      ground-glass appearance in the lungs on chest radiography. Interstitial lung 
      disease is a commonly reported adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor 
      (ICI) treatment; however, there are few reports of ICI treatment-associated PCP 
      infection. A 77-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma was administered 
      pembrolizumab and hospitalized for dyspnea 2 weeks after treatment. Chest 
      computed tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacities in all lung lobes. 
      PCP was therefore diagnosed, and steroids and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were 
      initiated. Following treatment, the patient's condition improved promptly. This 
      report suggests that ICI treatment can cause PCP infection.

      curative resection of esophageal cancer.
PG  - 172-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.06.1978 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and toxicity of definitive 
      radiochemotherapy for solitary lymph node metastasis after curative surgery of 
      esophageal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective review of 
      35 patients who underwent definitive radiochemotherapy at Tohoku University 
      Hospital between 2000 and 2009 for solitary lymph node metastasis after curative 
      esophagectomy with lymph node dissection for esophageal cancer. Radiotherapy 
      doses ranged from 60 to 66 Gy (median, 60 Gy). Concurrent chemotherapy was 
      platinum based in all patients. The endpoints of the present study were overall 
      survival, cause-specific survival, progression-free survival, irradiated-field 
      control, overall tumor response, and prognostic factors. RESULTS: The median 
      observation period for survivors was 70.0 months. The 5-year overall survival was 
      39.2% (median survival, 39.0 months). The 5-year cause-specific survival, 
      progression-free survival, and irradiated-field control were 43.3%, 31.0% and 
      59.9%, respectively. Metastatic lesion, size of the metastatic lymph node, and 
      performance status before radiochemotherapy were significantly correlated with 
      prognosis. Complete response and partial response were observed in 22.9% and 
      57.1% of the patients, respectively. There was no Grade 3 or higher adverse 
      effect based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) 
      in the late phase. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study findings, approximately 40% of 
      patients with solitary lymph node metastasis after curative resection for 
      esophageal cancer have a chance of long-term survival with definitive 
      radiochemotherapy.

      neuropathy in Chinese patients with early-stage breast cancer: A nation-wide 
      multicenter study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) is a debilitating adverse 
      effect of cancer treatments with taxanes which may require a reduction or 
      discontinuation chemotherapy and affect clinical and survival outcomes. A number 
      of factors have contributed to the increasing prevalence of TIPN. Nonetheless, 
      limited knowledge exists of potential prechemotherapy blood-based biochemical 
      factors associated with TIPN development. METHODS: We recruited breast cancer 
      patients at seven cancer institutions in China. Participants aged 18 years or 
      older with stage I to III breast cancer who scheduled to undergo primary 
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with taxanes were eligible. Eligible 
      patients underwent patient-reported neuropathy assessments using the EORTC-CIPN20 
      questionnaire. Patients completed the questionnaire before commencing treatment 
      and after every cycle. For every patient, we selected the highest TIPN toxicity 
      score for analysis since the first cycle. The posttreatment TIPN severity was 
      compared with blood-based biochemical factors within 30 days before commencing 
      treatment. Independent samples t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests and linear 
      regression were used to identify blood-based and clinical associations with TIPN 
      development. RESULTS: The study included 873 breast cancer participants who 
      received paclitaxel, docetaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel. In 
      the whole cohort, factors associated with higher TIPN toxicity scores were higher 
      cumulative chemotherapy dose (β = 0.005; 95% CI, 0.004 to 0.006; P < .001), lower 
      sodium ions (β = -0.24; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.09; P = .002) and higher chloride 
      ions (β = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.44; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings 
      suggest that breast cancer patients with a higher cumulative chemotherapy dose, 
      lower pretreatment sodium ions, and higher pretreatment chloride ions receiving 
      taxanes should receive closer monitoring to mitigate the development of 
      short-term and long-term TIPN.

TI  - Paraneoplastic Pemphigus Revealed by Anti-programmed Death-1 Pembrolizumab 
      Therapy for Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Complicating Hidradenitis

AB  - A 64-year-old patient developed a widespread autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering 
      disease 3 weeks after the initiation of the anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) 
      pembrolizumab therapy administered for a locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell 
      carcinoma (SCC) of the buttocks arising from hidradenitis suppurativa. A 
      diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) was made based on the presence of a 
      suprabasal acantholysis associated with intercellular deposits of immunoglobulin 
      G and C3 on basement membrane zone. Analysis of the patient's sera was positive 
      on monkey bladder and detected circulating antibodies against desmoglein 3 and 
      desmoplakin I prior to the initiation of pembrolizumab. At that time, the patient 
      had few localized blisters limited to the peri-tumoral skin of the buttocks with 
      acantholysis but without in vivo immune deposits. Pembrolizumab therapy was 
      discontinued and a complete remission of PNP was obtained using oral steroids. 
      Reintroduction of pembrolizumab resulted in flare of PNP. Given the close 
      temporal relation between pembrolizumab initiation and the subsequent clinical 
      expression of a widespread PNP, the patient was diagnosed with pre-existing 
      subclinical PNP exacerbated by PD-1 inhibitor. The extreme rarity of PNP in the 
      setting of cutaneous SCC and the effects of challenge, dechallenge, and 
      rechallenge of pembrolizumab argue in favor of a checkpoint inhibitor related 
      adverse effect. Our case is the first PNP associated with anti-PD-1 therapy and 
      serological follow-up suggest that one infusion of pembrolizumab is sufficient to 
      allow clinical expression of underlying pemphigus auto-immunity.

TI  - A COMMON PITUITARY AUTOANTIBODY IN TWO PATIENTS WITH IMMUNE CHECKPOINT 
      INHIBITOR-MEDIATED HYPOPHYSITIS: ZCCHC8.
PG  - e151-e160
LID - 10.4158/ACCR-2019-0585 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypophysitis is an increasingly recognized adverse effect of immune 
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for malignancy. However, the mechanisms 
      through which ICIs induce hypophysitis are largely unknown. We aim to describe 2 
      cases of ICI-mediated hypophysitis and perform autoantibody profiling on serial 
      samples from these patients to determine if common autoantibodies could be 
      identified. METHODS: We describe 2 cases of patients with metastatic urothelial 
      cancer who received ICI therapy and subsequently developed severe fatigue, 
      prompting a hormonal workup consistent with hypopituitarism. Patient 1 received 
      the ICI ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) and patient 
      2 received the ICI pembrolizumab (anti-programmed cell death protein 1). Both 
      patients had serial seromic immune biomarker profiling using high-density protein 
      arrays before and after developing hypophysitis. Once a common autoantibody was 
      found, zinc finger CCHC-type containing 8 (ZCCHC8), we used immunohistochemistry 
      to assess its presence in pituitary tissue. RESULTS: Of a limited number of 
      increased autoantibodies detected, those to ZCCHC8 were the only common 
      antibodies to increase at least 3-fold post-hypophysitis in both patients. Using 
      immunohistochemistry staining, we show for the first time that ZCCHC8 is 
      expressed in pituitary gland tissue. CONCLUSION: Seromic profiling identified a 
      common autoantibody, ZCCHC8, in 2 patients who developed hypophysitis on ICI 
      therapy, and other serial autoantibody increases in each patient. These findings 
      warrant validation in other cohorts to determine if the response is to self or 
      tumor antigen, and may reveal novel insights into pituitary gland physiology and 
      the pathogenesis of ICI-mediated hypophysitis.

PG  - 157-61
LID - 10.1002/mus.25141 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: While anticancer immunotherapies have traditionally focused on 
      activation of the immune system, there is recent interest in disinhibition of the 
      natural antitumor immune response by targeting immune checkpoints such as 
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 
      (PD-1). One humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, pembrolizumab, was 
      recently approved for treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma. METHODS: We 
      report exacerbation of myasthenia gravis (MG) after treatment with pembrolizumab 
      and provide a brief literature review. RESULTS: We describe a 75-year-old man 
      with stable MG who experienced myasthenic crisis in the setting of pembrolizumab 
      treatment. A concurrent azathioprine taper was a possible although unlikely 
      contributor given the short time interval between taper and exacerbation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: As long-term data become available regarding the adverse immune 
      effects of novel checkpoint inhibitors, clinicians should be mindful of their 
      risks/benefits and of possible autoimmune disease exacerbation. Muscle Nerve 54:

      Patients.
PG  - 455-459
LID - 10.18926/AMO/60808 [doi]
AB  - Taxanes are key drugs for patients with breast cancer. A major adverse effect 
      associated with the administration of the taxane docetaxel is 
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). We are conducting a 
      singlecenter, single-arm, open-label historical control trial to evaluate the 
      ability of compression therapy using stockings or sleeves to prevent CIPN due to 
      docetaxel treatment. The primary endpoint is the incidence of all-grade CIPN 
      according to patients' records until 3 weeks after the fourth docetaxel 
      administration. This study's results will clarify whether compression therapy 
      using stockings or sleeves can prevent CIPN in breast cancer patients.

AB  - The stabilization of spindle fibersis important for successful vitrification of 
      bovine oocytes because microtubules and other cytoskeleton fibers (CSF) can be 
      damaged during vitrification, resulting in failure of fertilization after 
      thawing. Docetaxel, a stabilizing agent, could potentially reduce CSF damage of 
      bovine oocytes induced during vitrification. However, there have been no reports 
      on the effects of docetaxel on their vitrification. Experiment 1 was conducted to 
      investigate the effects of various doses of docetaxel (0.0, 0.05, 0.5, 5.0 and 50 
      μM) in preincubation medium of in vitro matured (IVM) bovine oocytes on their 
      developmental ability after in vitro fertilization (IVF). The results show that 
      0.05 μM docetaxel had no adverse effect on embryo development, while docetaxel at 
      a concentration of ⩾0.5 μM inhibited development. Experiments 2 and 3 were 
      conducted to investigate the effects of preincubation of IVM bovine oocytes with 
      0.05 μM docetaxel for 30 min prior to vitrification-warming on CSF integrity 
      (Experiment 2), and on oocyte survival and viability after IVF (Experiment 3). 
      When preincubated with 0.05 μM docetaxel for 30 min before vitrification, 
      post-thawed oocytes had less CSF damage and higher survival rates compared with 
      those untreated with docetaxel before vitrification. Surviving oocytes also had 
      higher rates of cleavage and development to the blastocyst stage after IVF. In 
      conclusion, preincubation of IVM bovine oocytes with 0.05 μM docetaxel for 30 min 
      before vitrification was effective at preventing CSF damage during vitrification, 
      and improving oocyte viability after warming and subsequent cleavage and 
      blastocyst formation after IVF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death 1 inhibitors have revolutionized therapy for 
      cancer by their outstanding effectiveness. However, they may cause adverse 
      effects, among which inflammatory myopathy is one of the most disabling. To 
      elucidate its mechanism, we analysed muscle biopsies and compared them with other 
      inflammatory myopathies. METHODS: Muscle biopsies from three patients with 
      inflammatory myopathy after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors for cancer were 
      subjected to immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses to localize CD8+ 
      cytotoxic cells and markers of lymphoid follicles. For comparison, two cases of 
      polymyositis and one of juvenile dermatomyositis were examined. RESULTS: Nearly 
      identical pathological features were observed in the three cases. In the 
      island-like foci of inflammation, muscle fibers were undergoing degeneration. 
      CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, macrophages, CD4+ cells, and B cells were observed in the 
      foci. CD8+ cells were seen outside and inside the basal lamina of non-necrotic 
      muscle fibers. Lymphoid follicle-like structures with CD21+ follicular dendritic 
      cells were present. The blood vessels in the foci showed features consistent with 
      the high endothelial venules, on which their markers, PNAd and CCL21, were 
      expressed. In polymyositis, blood vessels stained only faintly for PNAd and 
      CCL21, while in juvenile dermatomyositis, in which tertiary lymphoid 
      follicle-like structure was reported in the past, they stained positively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In inflammatory myopathy associated with PD-1 inhibitors, CD8+ cells 
      appear to predominantly destruct muscle fibers. The presence of lymphoid 
      follicle-like structures and expression of PNAd and CCL21 on the endothelial 
      cells suggest the tertiary lymphoid organs are formed, and involved in the 
      leakage of lymphocytes. Thus, in the three cases examined, formation of the 
      tertiary lymphoid organs is likely to play an important role in genesis of the 
      PD-1 myopathy.

TI  - Robust, Responsive, and Targeted PLGA Anticancer Nanomedicines by Combination of 
      Reductively Cleavable Surfactant and Covalent Hyaluronic Acid Coating.
PG  - 3985-3994
LID - 10.1021/acsami.6b15105 [doi]
AB  - PLGA-based nanomedicines have enormous potential for targeted cancer therapy. To 
      boost their stability, targetability, and intracellular drug release, here we 
      developed novel multifunctional PLGA anticancer nanomedicines by combining a 
      reductively cleavable surfactant (RCS), vitamin E-SS-oligo(methyl diglycol 
      l-glutamate), with covalent hyaluronic acid (HA) coating. Reduction-sensitive 
      HA-coated PLGA nanoparticles (rHPNPs) were obtained with small sizes of 55-61 nm 
      and ζ potentials of -26.7 to -28.8 mV at 18.4-40.3 wt % RSC. rHPNPs were stable 
      against dilution and 10% FBS while destabilized under reductive condition. The 
      release studies revealed significantly accelerated docetaxel (DTX) release in the 
      presence of 10 mM glutathione. DTX-rHPNPs exhibited potent and specific antitumor 
      effect to CD44 + A549 lung cancer cells (IC(50) = 0.52 μg DTX equiv/mL). The in 
      vivo studies demonstrated that DTX-rHPNPs had an extended circulation time and 
      greatly enhanced tolerance in mice. Strikingly, DTX-rHPNPs completely inhibited 
      growth of orthotopic human A549-Luc lung tumor in mice, leading to a 
      significantly improved survival rate and reduced adverse effect as compared to 
      free DTX. This study highlights that advanced nanomedicines can be rationally 
      designed by combining functional surfactants and surface coating.

AB  - Mismatch repair protein deficiency occurs in 0.8-2% of pancreatic ductal 
      adenocarcinomas and confers susceptibility to immunotherapy. Herein, we report 
      the case of a patient with Lynch syndrome-associated, locally advanced mismatch

      sustained response to second-line treatment with pembrolizumab, but eventually 
      developed immune-related diabetic ketoacidosis requiring discontinuation of 
      treatment. He has since remained in remission, off treatment, over the following 
      3 years, with regular surveillance showing no clinical or radiographic evidence 
      of disease progression. The patient's unusual disease course raises the question 
      of whether this serious immune-related adverse event affecting the organ of 
      malignant involvement may have predicted his remarkable and durable response.

OAB - Lay abstract A small subgroup of pancreatic cancers have mutations preventing 
      effective repair of damaged DNA; a condition termed ‘mismatch repair protein 
      deficiency’. These tumors are often effectively treated with immunotherapy. Here 
      we describe a patient whose mismatch repair protein deficiency pancreatic cancer 
      responded well to pembrolizumab immunotherapy, but who later developed diabetes 
      as an immunotherapy-related adverse effect. Treatment was stopped, but his tumor 
      remained stable off treatment over the next 3 years. His unique clinical course 
      raises the question of whether the development of diabetes, a pancreas-specific 
      adverse effect, may have predicted the effective treatment of pancreatic cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy has shown a 
      favorable efficacy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
      Conversely, K-RAS mutations were reported to have an adverse effect on the 
      survival of patients with NSCLC. These studies suggest that the tumor biology of 
      patients with EGFR or K-RAS mutations is different from that of patients with 
      wild-type mutations. Therefore, we hypothesized that the response to cytotoxic 
      chemotherapy may differ among patients with and without EGFR or K-RAS mutations. 
      METHODS: A total of 229 patients with advanced NSCLC who received platinum 
      doublet chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study, and their 
      clinical outcomes were analyzed according to EGFR and K-RAS mutation status. 
      RESULTS: EGFR and K-RAS mutations were found in 52.4% and 27.9% of patients, 
      respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly higher in 
      patients with EGFR mutations than in patients with wild-type EGFR (P = .008), and 
      multivariate analysis showed that EGFR mutation was an independent factor to 
      chemotherapy (P = .01). Among the patients with EGFR mutations, the disease 
      control rate for docetaxel was higher than for gemcitabine-based therapy (P = 
      .031). In addition, docetaxel or vinorelbine showed a longer PFS than 
      gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations (P = .033 and P = 
      .028). However, no similar differences were found according to the K-RAS 
      mutations. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR, but not K-RAS mutation, is associated with improved 
      survival time to platinum-based chemotherapy. In patients with EGFR mutations, 
      PFS for docetaxel and gemcitabine was higher than for vinorelbine-based 
      chemotherapies. The predictive meaning of EGFR mutation for chemotherapy should 
      be further investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is a distressing adverse effect 
      of many chemotherapy agents. The TC (docetaxel [Taxotere] and cyclophosphamide) 
      chemotherapy regimen is typically associated with complete alopecia. Scalp 
      cooling with cold caps has been reported to minimize or prevent CIA. We conducted 
      a prospective study to assess efficacy of scalp cooling in preventing CIA among 
      women receiving adjuvant TC chemotherapy for breast cancer. METHODS: Women at the 
      Weill Cornell Breast Center who independently elected to use scalp cooling with 
      cold caps during adjuvant TC chemotherapy were asked to participate. Degree of 
      hair loss was assessed by a single practitioner using Dean's alopecia scale 
      (grade 1/excellent [< 25% hair loss], grade 2/good [25%-50% hair loss], grade 
      3/moderate [50%-75% hair loss], grade 4/poor [> 75% hair loss]), by digital 
      photographs, and by patient self-report of hair thinning or the need to wear a 
      wig/head covering, or both. Assessments were made before each chemotherapy 
      treatment and at follow-up visits between 3 weeks and 3 months after completion 
      of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of 20 evaluable patients, 10% reported a need to wear a 
      wig/head covering at the follow-up visit. Dean's alopecia score was excellent for 
      65% of patients, good for 25% of patients, and moderate or poor for 10% of 
      patients. The majority of patients reported hair thinning after every 
      chemotherapy cycle. No patient discontinued therapy because of an intolerance to 
      cold caps. CONCLUSION: Scalp cooling with cold caps appears to be effective in 
      preventing CIA among the majority of women undergoing treatment with TC 
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Concomitant use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors prevent 
      trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity in HER2+ breast cancer patients: an 
      institutional retrospective study.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/s40959-019-0043-8 [doi]
LID - 9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is an adverse effect of trastuzumab (TRA) in the 
      treatment of human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer. 
      Current literature on the cardioprotective effects of agents targeted against the 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and beta-blockers (BB) in TRA-treated 
      HER2+ breast cancer patients is conflicting. We hypothesized that concurrent use 
      of RAAS inhibitors would prevent TRA-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC). METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Surveillance ejection fraction (EF) at 3-month intervals up to 
      36 months obtained from echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scans 
      were retrospectively compared to baseline EF in TRA-treated HER2+ breast cancer 
      patients between 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary cancer center. TIC was defined as a 
      decrease of EF by more than 15 EF percentage points from baseline on surveillance 
      imaging. Cardiac medications and comorbidities were compared between patients 
      with reduced EF secondary to TIC (rEF) and patients who did not experience TIC 
      (pEF). A published clinical risk score (CRS) was applied to the patient 
      population with calculated sensitivity analyses to determine if the CRS could 
      predict TIC. RESULTS: Of 127 patients with TRA-treated HER2+ breast cancer, 11% 
      developed cardiotoxicity resulting in discontinuation of TRA. Cardiotoxicity with 
      reduced EF was seen as early as 3 months and at subsequent 3-month follow up 
      intervals up to the 15-month follow-up. Co-existing arrhythmia, coronary artery 
      disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) tended to infer an 
      increased risk for cardiotoxicity. Patients with pEF were found to be 
      concurrently on a RAAS inhibitor more than the rEF group (OR of 0.24, 95% CI 
      0.05-1.11, p 0.06). The CRS high-risk cut-off had a sensitivity of 0.17 (95% CI 
      0.03-0.49), specificity of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.94), positive predictive value of 
      0.14 (95% CI 0.03-0.44) and negative predictive value of 0.91 (95% CI 0.84-0.95). 
      CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the concurrent use of a RAAS inhibitors during 
      TRA treatment may provide a protective effect against TIC and warrants further 
      investigation. The low sensitivity and positive predictive value demonstrated 
      that the CRS has minimal utility as a screening tool for prediction of patients 
      at high risk for TIC. Therefore, closer surveillance of patients receiving TRA is 
      warranted for early detection of TIC.

TI  - Somatic p.T771R KDR (VEGFR2) Mutation Arising in a Sporadic Angioma During 
      Ramucirumab Therapy.
PG  - 1240-3
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.1925 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Inhibition of angiogenesis is an effective anticancer strategy 
      because neoplasms require a rich blood supply. Ramucirumab, approved by the US 
      Food and Drug Administration in 2014 to treat gastric adenocarcinomas and 
      non-small cell lung carcinomas, targets vascular endothelial growth factor 2 
      (VEGFR2). We identified a patient prescribed a regimen of irinotecan 
      hydrochloride, cetuximab, and ramucirumab for metastatic rectal cancer (diagnosed 
      in November 2013 and treated through early January 2015) who developed a 
      new-onset, expanding vascular lesion on his right leg. Via exome sequencing, we 
      found that the lesion contained a single somatic mutation in KDR (encodes 
      VEGFR2), possibly in response to ramucirumab. Vascular tumors are not a known 
      complication of antiangiogenic therapeutics. OBSERVATIONS: Exome sequencing of 
      the well-demarcated, blanching vascular lesion on the lateral right shin revealed 
      a somatic p.T771R mutation in KDR, without evidence of other somatic mutations or 
      loss of heterozygosity. Histological features included lobules of small vessels 
      within the dermis, resembling a tufted angioma. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A 
      potential adverse effect of ramucirumab in combination therapy is the development 
      of sporadic angiomas. The p.T771R mutation was previously implicated in 
      autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 and reported in angiosarcomas alongside other 
      driver mutations. Our observations suggest that this mutation confers a 
      proliferative advantage in the setting of ramucirumab therapy. Patients receiving 
      ramucirumab should be monitored for the development of new vascular lesions.

TI  - Reliability of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction from Three-Dimensional 
      Echocardiography for Cardiotoxicity Onset Detection in Patients with Breast 
      Cancer.
PG  - 1103-1110
LID - S0894-7317(17)30526-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.echo.2017.06.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of various 
      chemotherapeutic agents that can be monitored by echocardiography. A decrease in 
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) triggers consideration for therapy 
      modification or interruption. The aim of this study was to evaluate how 
      variability in LVEF estimates computed using three-dimensional echocardiography 
      could influence cardiotoxicity onset detection. METHODS: One hundred eighty one 
      patients with breast cancer treated with anthracycline and trastuzumab were 
      analyzed. LVEF was computed using two commercial software packages. In a subgroup 
      of 40 patients, three-dimensional echocardiographic data were reanalyzed to 
      assess intra- and interobserver variability by two expert investigators using 
      both packages. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) imaging was evaluated in 64 
      patients. RESULTS: End-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and LVEF 
      measurements obtained applying the two software packages were in good agreement, 
      with small bias and acceptable limits of agreement. Intra- and interobserver 
      variability was smaller using one of the two software packages. However, for both 
      packages, variability indexes were in the range of affecting LVEF estimates at a 
      level that could lead to an inaccurate assessment of cardiac adverse effects of 
      cancer therapeutic drugs. On the basis of LVEF, 11 of 181 patients (6.1%) had 
      cardiotoxicity at 3-month follow-up. The absolute value of GLS was smaller in 16 
      of 64 patients (25%) thought to have cardiotoxicity on the basis of GLS results, 
      including six of seven patients who had cardiotoxicity considering LVEF in this 
      subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Following clinical definition of cardiotoxicity onset, 
      variability in LVEF computation by three-dimensional echocardiography could be a 
      confounding factor for cardiotoxicity diagnosis, and different software packages 
      should not be used interchangeably for LVEF monitoring. GLS confirms its 
      predictive value for subsequent cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab, 
      now FDA-approved for use in treating several types of cancer, have been 
      associated with immune-related adverse effects. Specifically, the antibodies 
      targeting the programmed-cell death-1 immune checkpoint, pembrolizumab and 
      nivolumab, have been rarely reported to induce the development of type 1 diabetes 
      mellitus. Here we describe a case of a patient who developed antibody-positive 
      type 1 diabetes mellitus following treatment with pembrolizumab in combination 
      with systemic chemotherapy for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. We will 
      also provide a brief literature review of other rarely reported cases of type 1 
      diabetes presenting after treatment with pembrolizumab and nivolumab, as well as 
      discussion regarding potential mechanisms of this adverse effect and its 
      importance as these drugs continue to become even more widespread.

AB  - (Neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer is associated with 
      side-effects, resulting in increased emergency department (ED) presentations. 
      Treatment-related toxicity can affect quality of life, compromise chemotherapy 
      delivery and treatment outcomes, and increase healthcare use. We performed a 
      retrospective study of ED presentations in patients receiving curative 
      chemotherapy for early breast cancer to identify factors contributing to ED 
      presentations. Of 102 patients, 39 (38%) presented to ED within 30 days of 
      chemotherapy, resulting in 63 ED presentations in total. Most common reasons were 
      non-neutropenic fever (17 presentations/27%), neutropenic fever (15/24%), pain 
      (9/14%), drug reaction (6/10%) and infection (4/6%). Factors significantly 
      associated with ED presentation were adjuvant chemotherapy timing compared to 
      neoadjuvant timing (P = 0.031), prophylactic antibiotics (P = 0.045) and 
      docetaxel-containing regimen (P = 0.018).

      case.
PG  - 497-500
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hyu023 [doi]
AB  - A 71-year-old female with Stage IIIB primary adenocarcinoma was administered a 
      three-drug combination therapy consisting of docetaxel, cisplatin and bevacizumab 
      as a first-line treatment based on the Phase II clinical trial. On the 32nd day 
      after the fourth course of chemotherapy, the patient developed bloody sputum. She 
      was found dead at home on the 34th day. Autopsy revealed a diffuse alveolar 
      hemorrhage without diffuse alveolar damage. Endothelial cells of the small 
      arteries and capillaries were swollen and desquamated, indicating that alveolar 
      capillaries were injured. The similar pathological changes in blood vessels were 
      also observed in the kidney and the digestive tract. Because diffuse alveolar 
      hemorrhage caused by cisplatin and docetaxel has never been reported apart from 
      interstitial pneumonitis, bevacizumab is the most suspicious drug for diffuse 
      alveolar hemorrhage in our case. Chest physicians and oncologists should be aware 
      that although it is very rare, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage can develop during any 
      course of chemotherapy with bevacizumab.

AB  - A 61-year-old woman with stage IVA lung adenocarcinoma exhibited high PD-L1 
      expression. Pembrolizumab was administered as second-line therapy. She developed 
      destructive thyroiditis and her thyroid function started to decline during the 
      administration of three to five courses. She was subsequently diagnosed with 
      fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis during the eighth course and 
      insulin treatment was initiated. Pembrolizumab remained effective and was 
      continued for 21 courses, even after the onset of diabetes mellitus. 
      Immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatment can be continued with hormone replacement 
      even after the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus as an immune-related 
      adverse event.

TI  - Hyperprogressive Disease in an Advanced Stage Colon Cancer Patient on 
      Pembrolizumab: A Case Report.
PG  - e7764
LID - 10.7759/cureus.7764 [doi]
LID - e7764
AB  - The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in recent years has 
      transformed the landscape of the management of solid tumors. The advancement of 
      immunotherapy has resulted in a brand new set of adverse outcomes not previously 
      seen in classical chemotherapy. One such adverse effect has been termed as 
      hyperprogressive disease (HPD), a phenomenon characterized by rapid tumor 
      progression, which often leads to devastating outcomes. In this report, we 
      present a unique case of a 48-year-old African American female who initially 
      presented with abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. Subsequent CT scan 
      showed extensive irregular wall and luminal narrowing with an eccentric mass and 
      adenopathy along the portacaval space. Tumor markers were found to be elevated 
      and genetic testing was done. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIC colon 
      cancer with K-RAS wild type, associated with Lynch syndrome. The patient 
      underwent surgical resection, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy for 
      progressive/stage IV disease. In light of the progression of the disease, 
      pembrolizumab was introduced into the treatment regimen. One month after the 
      treatment, a repeat CT scan showed enlargement of the metastatic lesion with 
      almost double the size. The progression of the disease was so rapid and, 
      ultimately, pembrolizumab administration was withheld and the patient passed away 
      after about two months on pembrolizumab. To our knowledge, this is one of the few 
      cases of HPD reported in patients with advanced colon cancer, particularly in 
      one with Lynch syndrome. Further studies are warranted to understand why some 
      individuals benefit from immunotherapy, whereas others experience grave outcomes.

LID - 10.1002/jcu.22975 [doi]
AB  - While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have antitumor effects, they also have 
      characteristic side effects, including colitis. However, gastritis has rarely 
      been reported. We report a case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who 
      presented with epigastric pain and diarrhea following pembrolizumab 
      administration. Sonography of the abdomen demonstrated diffuse, although mild, 
      gastric wall thickening (mainly in the submucosa), as well as a slight decrease 
      in echogenicity throughout the gastric wall. While the mucosal surface was 
      relatively smooth, color Doppler examination showed increased vascularity. 
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis 
      of ICI-related gastroenteritis.

TI  - Onycholysis associated with weekly administration of paclitaxel.
PG  - 584-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report an unusual reaction associated with weekly administration of 
      paclitaxel. CASE SUMMARIES: Onycholysis was seen in four women with recurrent 
      ovarian cancer being treated with low-dose, weekly paclitaxel. Two of the 
      patients had previously received higher doses of paclitaxel on an 
      every-three-week schedule without similar reactions. Onycholysis developed 
      between weeks 10-13 of treatment in three of the patients. In the fourth patient, 
      it developed shortly after initiation of weekly paclitaxel. None of the reactions 
      required dose adjustments or discontinuation of therapy. Direct toxicity to the 
      nail bed or inhibition of angiogenesis are possible mechanisms for this reaction. 
      DISCUSSION: Onycholysis, separation of the nail from the nail bed, is an 
      infrequent adverse effect of drug therapy. Antineoplastic drugs have previously 
      been reported to cause onycholysis, pigmentation, bands, thickening or thinning 
      of the nail bed, and nail shedding. Nail changes with the taxanes, primarily 
      docetaxel, are reported in up to 30-40% of patients. Paclitaxel is not commonly 
      associated with dermatologic reactions, although localized skin reactions and 
      tissue necrosis have been reported. Nail changes, pigmentation or discoloration 
      of the nail bed, occur in 2% of patients receiving paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Onycholysis is an uncommon reaction that may occur in some patients receiving 
      weekly, low-dose paclitaxel therapy. The reaction is not life-threatening and 
      does not warrant discontinuation of therapy. However, clinicians should be aware 
      of the possibility of this effect and be prepared to advise patients who develop 
      signs of nail changes.

TI  - Case Report: Complete Response to Antiangiogenesis and Immune Checkpoint Blockade 
      in an Unresectable MMR-Deficient Leiomyosarcoma Harboring Biallelic Loss of PTEN.
PG  - 802074
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.802074 [doi]
LID - 802074
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant smooth muscle neoplasm, in which 
      the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is very limited. What is worse, 
      loss of PTEN, known as a negative factor for ICB, frequently occurred in LMS. 
      Seeking new strategies for LMS patients harboring loss of PTEN is important and 
      challenging. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Chinese male was diagnosed as 
      having unresectable LMS of the iliopsoas. After the failure of two prior 
      chemotherapy regimens, whole-exome sequencing revealed that tumor tissue had high 
      tumor mutation burden (689 Muts), high microsatellite instability, and some 
      somatic mutations, including PTEN (copy number loss and p.N323fs), MSH6 
      (p.F1088fs), TP53 p.R273C, ASXL1 p.G645fs, ATR p.S1843P, and CDKN2A p.A118P. 
      Then, antiangiogenic agent (pazopanib or anlotinib) plus pembrolizumab was 
      administered from January 2 to August 6, 2018. However, pazopanib was stopped on 
      June 18 due to the grade 2/3 adverse effect of hand-foot skin reaction, and 
      anlotinib was administered. Considering that the tumor shrunk after 
      immunotherapy, he underwent radical resection on September 6, 2018. The final 
      pathological diagnosis confirmed pathologic complete response (CR). Until the 
      latest follow-up (September 15, 2021), no progressive disease was observed and 
      total disease-free survival has exceeded 36 months. CONCLUSION: We presented a 
      patient with an unresectable mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient LMS harboring 
      biallelic loss of PTEN who achieved CR from a combination strategy of 
      antiangiogenesis plus pembrolizumab. Such a strategy might be a promising 
      strategy to overcome the ICB resistance caused by the loss of PTEN. Such 
      conclusions need to be further confirmed in further investigations.

TI  - Acute interstitial nephritis after sequential ipilumumab - nivolumab therapy of 
      metastatic melanoma.
PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/s40425-017-0261-2 [doi]
LID - 57
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anti-Programmed Death receptor 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies nivolumab 
      and pembrolizumab are new treatments in metastatic melanoma. Immunotherapies are 
      best known to be responsible for thrombotic microangiopathy. However, immune 
      interstitial nephritis has been described in a patient treated by nivolumab and 
      ipilimumab concomitantly, and three cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis 
      have been reported with ipilimumab monotherapy. We report herein a case of acute 
      interstitial immune nephritis in a patient treated with nivolumab after 
      ipilimumab for pulmonary metastatic melanoma. CASE PRESENTATION: Interstitial 
      nephritis was diagnosed after acute kidney injury following three cycles and was 
      confirmed by kidney biopsy. Kidney injury responded rapidly to prednisolone, 
      which was then gradually reduced. As a follow-up computed tomography scan 
      indicated mixed response, with minimal size progression of a pulmonary nodule, 
      but a significant reduction in the size of the other nodules, nivolumab was 
      reintroduced after renal function improvement. Low-dose corticosteroids were 
      first maintained during nivolumab treatment and subsequently discontinued. Only 
      one month after prednisolone discontinuation, creatinine levels increased. A 
      second kidney biopsy confirmed relapse of acute interstitial nephritis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of nivolumab-induced acute 
      interstitial immune nephritis. This case highlights that anti-PD-1 immunotherapy 
      may be continued when renal function is adequate, and this requires close 
      interaction between dermatologists and nephrologists. This adverse effect should 
      be made known to prescribers as nivolumab is associated with significant 
      improvement of survival in metastatic melanoma and may be used in many different 
      types of cancer.

AB  - The immune system is often called a double-edged sword, due to the inextricable 
      link between cancer immunity and allergy/autoimmunity. Intriguingly, a growing 
      number of cases have been reported in which PD-1 blockade triggers the 
      exacerbation of tuberculosis (TB), an organ-invasive granulomatous disease caused 
      by bacterial infection. As a result, the exacerbation of TB is now considered a 
      severe adverse effect of nivolumab and pembrolizumab. In this letter, we report 
      the strong expression of PD-L1 in epithelioid granulomatous lesions in 
      tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, and foreign body granuloma. In 
      addition, we discussed the exacerbation of tuberculosis after anti-PD-1 
      antibody-based cancer immunotherapy.

      with T-DM1: a report of two cases.
PG  - 391
LID - 10.1186/s12885-016-2464-1 [doi]
LID - 391
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple new targeted agents have been developed for patients with 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) - positive breast cancer. 
      Patients with HER2- positive breast cancer will develop brain metastases with 
      greater incidence than patients with non-HER2 cancers, and many of them will 
      undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or other CNS radiotherapy. The 
      interaction between radiation effects and new targeted agents is not well 
      understood. We report two cases suggesting a novel adverse effect of T-DM1 
      (trastuzumab emtansine) on symptomatic enlargement of radiation necrosis (RN) 
      after SRS. CASE PRESENTATION: Two patients with HER2-positive breast cancer had 
      received SRS for single brain metastasis more than 5-years ago. They had been 
      heavily treated for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (trastuzumab and 
      pacritaxel, lapatinib and capecitabine). They initiated T-DM1 therapy for 
      progressive systematic disease 5.5 years after stereotactic irradiation, when a 
      small RN was recognized on brain MR images of each patient. The RN lesions 
      increased in size and became symptomatic during 13 or 14 months of T-DM1 
      treatment. The patients underwent surgical resection of the lesion. Pathological 
      examination revealed necrosis, hematoma, granulation tissue and telangiectasia 
      without neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: A potential enhancement of RN by T-DM1 in 
      the brain may be one of important adverse events associated with the use of T-DM1 
      for patients after SRS. These cases highlight the need of careful follow-up when 
      combining new systemic targeted therapies and SRS for brain metastases.

TI  - Refractory Bullous Pemphigoid in a Patient with Metastatic Lung Adenocarcinoma 
      Treated with Pembrolizumab.
PG  - 386-390
LID - 10.1159/000514144 [doi]
AB  - We present the case of a 73-year-old male patient with a history of tobacco use 
      who presented with a central nervous system mass that was confirmed to be a lung 
      adenocarcinoma metastasis. High PD-L1 expression as well as negativity to other 
      targetable drivers led to initiation of pembrolizumab monotherapy and ablative 
      stereotactic radiation therapy on oligo-residual disease, achieving a complete 
      response after 2 years of therapy. Following discontinuation of systemic 
      treatment, the patient developed widespread desquamative plaques. A skin biopsy 
      revealed subepidermal blistering and eosinophilic infiltration in conjunction 
      with C3 and IgG depositions on the basement membrane, detected by 
      immunofluorescence. A diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was obtained, and systemic 
      corticosteroids were administered with lesion progression. Infliximab was also 
      administered without meaningful clinical improvement. Metronomic cyclophosphamide 
      achieved a complete resolution of skin lesions and up to this day the patient 
      continues with tumor control and is free of dermatological findings. In 
      conclusion, bullous pemphigoid is a very rare dermatological adverse effect 
      related with pembrolizumab treatment. Only two cases, including this one, have 
      been reported, especially with this medication for the treatment of non-small 
      cell lung cancer. With more reported cases, management strategies can be 
      optimized even in the steroid refractory setting.

TI  - A case of repetitive seizures following immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as a 
      feature of autoimmune encephalitis.
PG  - 733-738
LID - 10.1684/epd.2021.1319 [doi]
AB  - Pembrolizumab, an immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), is a humanized monoclonal 
      antibody that binds to programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) and thereby 
      inhibits binding to its ligand, which inhibits the suppression of activated T 
      cells by cancer cells, resulting in enhancing antitumour immunity. Although 
      several cases of encephalitis have been reported as immune-related adverse 
      effects of ICIs, epilepsy has not been reported following ICI treatment. We 
      describe the case of an elderly woman with bladder carcinoma who experienced two 
      episodes of generalized seizures after treatment with pembrolizumab. The episodes 
      were atypical of encephalitis, because the seizures were completely responsive to 
      AEDs and the CSF parameters normalized completely without immunotherapy. Since 
      interictal EEG revealed persistent epileptic discharges after the seizures, 
      pembrolizumab was considered to have induced a chronic state of epileptogenicity 
      as the possible pathology, with a clinical picture similar to that of autoimmune 
      epilepsy. The possibility that ICIs may cause an immune-related adverse effect, 
      such as a chronic epileptic condition, should be considered, since ICIs are used 
      widely.

TI  - An Unusual Case of Gastritis in One Patient Receiving PD-1 Blocking Therapy: 
      Coexisting Immune-Related Gastritis and Cytomegaloviral Infection.
PG  - 383-387
LID - 10.14740/gr1068w [doi]
AB  - The programmed death 1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T 
      lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) immune checkpoints are negative 
      regulators of T-cell immune function. Inhibition of these targets by antibodies 
      (PD-1 blocking therapy) has been explored to treat solid malignancies such as 
      melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers. PD-1 blocking therapy is 
      known to cause gastrointestinal tract adverse events in some patients and some of 
      the adverse events are thought to be immune-mediated. Cancer patients receiving 
      PD-1 blocking therapy have often failed several lines of chemotherapy and thus 
      potentially are susceptible to a variety of infections including cytomegaloviral 
      infection. However, there has not been any report of concurrent immune-mediated 
      gastroenterocolitis and cytomegaloviral infection in cancer patients receiving 
      PD-1 blocking therapy. Herein, we report one unusual case of histologically 
      confirmed gastritis with features of immune-mediated pangastritis and 
      cytomegaloviral infection in one patient who had metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
      and received PD-1 blocking therapy, initially with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 
      antibody) followed by a switch to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) because of 
      tumor progression. Pembrolizumab was held and intravenous ganciclovir treatment 
      was started, the patient's symptoms (abdominal pain and vomiting) were 
      significantly improved and she was discharged from the hospital in stable 
      conditions on hospital day 5. Pathologists should be aware of PD-1 blocking 
      therapy-associated immune-mediated gastrointestinal tract adverse effect and 
      concurrent cytomegaloviral infection.

TI  - Docetaxel-induced nail changes--a neurogenic mechanism: a case report.
PG  - 167-74
AB  - Docetaxel is a new taxoid widely used in chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer 
      and other solid malignancies. Painful nail changes with onycholysis occur in 
      about 40% of docetaxel-treated patients as a prominent adverse effect. We report 
      a patient with a complete peripheral palsy of the right arm due to advanced 
      breast cancer with diffuse tumor infiltration of the brachial plexus. Treatment 
      with docetaxel led to onycholysis at all extremities except the paretic hand. 
      Sensory and motoric innervation measured by nerve conduction studies showed a 
      complete loss of large nerve fiber function of the right arm. Function of deep 
      mechanosensitive A beta-fibers (quantitative vibrametry) was severely decreased, 
      but not absent. Sympathetic reflexes (induced by deep inspiration and measured 
      with laser Doppler flowmetry) were absent on the right side and skin temperature 
      was decreased consistent with a complete sympathetic denervation. Small afferent 
      fibers investigated by quantitative thermotesting revealed a total loss of 
      thermal and pain sensation. Furthermore, iontophoresis of histamine failed to 
      induce any axon reflex-vasodilatation indicating a complete peripheral 
      degeneration of small fiber afferents. In summary, a severe denervation of small 
      and large fibers of the right upper limb was revealed. These results indicate 
      that integrity of peripheral nerves seems to be a substantial factor for 
      docetaxel-mediated nail changes. The role of an inflammatory process in 
      onycholysis maintained by postganglionic sympathetic terminals and nociceptive 
      C-fiber afferents is discussed. In accordance with this hypothesis, a 
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor improved nail alterations of the non-paretic limbs.

TI  - Fetal Renal Insufficiency Following Trastuzumab Treatment for Breast Cancer in 
      Pregnancy: Case Report und Review of the Current Literature.
PG  - 475-478
AB  - Some drugs are known for their fetal nephrotoxicity and should be avoided during 
      pregnancy. We report on a pregnant woman suffering from breast cancer who 
      received a weekly neoadjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin(®)) therapy from 15 weeks of 
      gestation onward, in addition to a 3-weekly carboplatin/docetaxel chemotherapy. 
      Fetal renal insufficiency with anhydramnios and missing visualization of the 
      fetal bladder developed at 21 weeks. After discontinuation of trastuzumab and 
      repeated instillation of amniotic fluid, the amount of amniotic fluid remained 
      stable after 24 weeks of gestation. After caesarean section at 34 weeks because 
      of fetal growth restriction, the renal function of the neonate was normal 
      postnatally. In accordance with the current literature, our case shows a 
      reversible adverse effect of trastuzumab on the fetal renal function and confirms 
      the current recommendation that trastuzumab in pregnancy should be avoided. In 
      pregnancies exposed to trastuzumab, treatment should be discontinued and the 
      fetus should be closely monitored, with particular attention to the amniotic 
      fluid and the fetal bladder volume, as these reflect fetal renal function.

AB  - Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced 
      melanoma, with impressive survival benefits attained through upregulation of the 
      anticancer immune response. Blockade of regulatory checkpoint molecules can, 
      however, also result in aberrant immune activation leading to undesirable 
      inflammation and autoimmunity. Although many genetic determinants have been 
      described in patients with primary autoimmune diseases, it is uncertain whether 
      patients developing autoimmune skin disease as an adverse effect of anti-PD-1 
      therapy share the same genetic risks. Furthermore, it is also unclear whether 
      treatment with these agents can result in the unveiling of underlying 'silent' 
      autoimmunity resulting in chronic inflammatory disease. We report three cases of 
      cutaneous lupus associated with pembrolizumab therapy for advanced melanoma. One 
      patient had a previous diagnosis of histologically proven discoid lupus 
      erythematosus, well-controlled without treatment for over 2 years, which flared 
      on first exposure to pembrolizumab. The remaining two patients had no previous 
      history of autoimmune disease; both developed cutaneous eruptions, histologically 
      and immunohistologically, in keeping with subacute cutaneous lupus following 
      treatment with pembrolizumab. Our report bolsters what is currently an 
      exceedingly small body of evidence documenting the development of cutaneous lupus 
      in the setting of pembrolizumab therapy. Our third case specifically documents an 
      otherwise unreported severe reflare of previously diagnosed, quiescent discoid 
      lupus erythematosus in the setting of pembrolizumab, vividly highlighting the 
      potential for autoimmune and specifically, lupus reactivation in the setting of 
      anti-PD-1 therapy.

TI  - Phase II study of docetaxel plus cisplatin as a second-line combined therapy in 
      patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.
PG  - 2973-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a pilot phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and 
      safety of docetaxel and cisplatin as a combination second-line therapy for 
      advanced gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2003, 30 patients 
      were enrolled into this study. Chemotherapy consisted of 60 mg/m2 of docetaxel 
      followed by 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin. This regimen was repeated at least three times 
      at 3-week intervals. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 26.7%. The median 
      time to disease progression was 4.5 months. The median survival time was 13 
      months from the start of the first-line therapy and 6 months from the second-line 
      therapy. With respect to toxicity, the major adverse effect was leukopenia, which 
      reached grades 3-4 in 26.7%. Non-hematological toxicities were usually moderate, 
      and no deaths were attributable to the adverse effects of the drugs. CONCLUSION: 
      This combination therapy was effective as a second-line treatment for advanced 
      gastric cancer with acceptable toxic side-effects.

AB  - Taxane-induced pneumotoxicity is rare. However, 1-5% of patients taking docetaxel 
      may develop severe pneumotoxicity. This has been limited to case reports in the 
      literature. We report seven breast cancer patients who developed 
      docetaxel-induced diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) of an organizing 
      pneumonia pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The patients 
      presented with progressive breathlessness within four weeks of the final dose. 
      All had an organizing pneumonia pattern on their HRCTs, without other evidence of 
      infection. Restrictive lung disease with low carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 
      (DLCO) was noted, with desaturation on a 6-min walk test (6MWT). They were 
      started on prednisolone. Repeated HRCT after four to eight weeks from the 
      commencement of steroid treatment showed marked improvement. The clinical and 
      functional improvement were also significant. One patient succumbed to the 
      illness as a result of severe lung involvement. Docetaxel-induced DPLD is a fatal 
      adverse effect, which can be managed by the cessation of the drug and starting on 
      steroids in adequate doses.

AB  - Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor that has been 
      approved for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies including non-small-cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Immune-mediated colitis is a known adverse effect of 
      pembrolizumab which can lead to the treatment interruption, although not 
      compromising the control of the oncological disease. Herein, we report the case 
      of a 59-year-old woman on pembrolizumab for advanced NSCLC which developed a 
      severe and persistent colitis treated with infliximab for several months 
      following anti-PD-1 antibody discontinuation. This strategy resulted in an 
      improvement but not complete recovery of the gastrointestinal toxicity despite 
      revealed sustained response and control of the oncological disease with prolonged 
      survival over 24 months.

      study.
PG  - 289-294

AB  - Docetaxel, cisplatin plus fluorouracil (DCF) regimen is a useful chemotherapy, 
      but is sometimes withdrawn due to severe adverse effects (AE). In this study, we 
      examined whether the chronotherapy of DCF regimen could reduce the drugs-induced 
      toxicities in clinical practice. Patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma were 
      enrolled. Chemotherapy started at 10:30 (Morning-dosing) or 18:30 
      (Evening-dosing) for 5 days by a cross-over design. AE were assessed for 14 days 
      after an initiation of each dosing. The grades of nausea, vomiting and 
      neutropenia were smaller during Evening-dosing than during Morning-dosing. These 
      data suggest that the chrono-chemotherapy might provide a merit for reducing the 
      DCF regimen-related severe AE.

TI  - Chemoimmunotherapy-related enteritis resulting in a mechanical small bowel 
      obstruction - A case report.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Mechanical small bowel obstruction (SBO) is amongst 
      the commonest diagnoses encountered in surgical departments. Although the 
      aetiology is frequently post-surgical adhesions, the condition can arise in a 
      virgin abdomen and we now know several of these cases do not require acute 
      operative management. Here we report one such case where a small bowel 
      obstruction transpired due to enteritis in the setting of chemoimmunotherapy with 
      no prior abdominal surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62 year old male presented to 
      our department with 2 days of vomiting and obstipation. This is on a background 
      of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer for which he was due for his 4(th) cycle 
      of carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab. Computed Tomography (CT) of the 
      abdomen demonstrated a segment of thickened distal small bowel without any mass 
      lesion, along with upstream dilatation. The findings were consistent with a 
      mechanical SBO due to enteritis. Infective causes were excluded. The patient 
      successfully recovered with non-operative intervention in the coming days. 
      CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Enteritis is an established adverse effect of various 
      chemoimmunotherapy agents, though a case severe enough to produce a mechanical 
      bowel obstruction is exceptionally rare. We demonstrate through this case that 
      the condition may resolve through conservative measures. CONCLUSION: The 
      diagnosis of chemoimmunotherapy-related enteritis producing an SBO although 
      uncommon, should be considered in the relevant population. A non-operative 
      approach may be appropriate under some circumstances.

TI  - The novel DNA alkylating agent BO-1090 suppresses the growth of human oral cavity 
      cancer in xenografted and orthotopic mouse models.
PG  - 1440-50

AB  - Oral cancer is the fourth-most common cause of death in males and overall the 
      sixth-most common cause of cancer death in Taiwan. Surgery, radiotherapy and 
      chemotherapy combined with other therapies are the most common treatments for 
      oral cavity cancer. Although cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and docetaxel are commonly 
      used clinically, there is no drug specific for oral cavity cancer. Here, we 
      demonstrated that derivatives of 3a-aza-cyclopenta[a]indene, a class of newly 
      synthesized alkylating agents, may be drugs more specific for oral cancer based 
      on its potent in vitro cytotoxicity to oral cancer cells and on in vivo 
      xenografts. Among them, BO-1090, bis(hydroxymethyl)-3a-aza-cyclopenta[a]indene 
      derivative, targeted DNA for its cytotoxic effects as shown by inhibition of DNA 
      synthesis (bromodeoxyuridine-based DNA synthesis assay), induction of DNA 
      crosslinking (alkaline gel shift assay), and induction of DNA single-stranded 
      breaks (Comet assay) and double-stranded breaks (γ-H2AX focus formation). 
      Following DNA damage, BO-1090 induced G1/S-phase arrest and apoptosis in oral 
      cancer cell lines. The therapeutic potential of BO-1090 was tested in mice that 
      received a xenograft of oral cavity cancer cell lines (SAS or Cal 27 cells). 
      Intravenous injection of BO-1090 significantly suppressed tumor growth in 
      comparison to control mice. BO-1090 also significantly reduced the tumor burden 
      in orthotopic mouse models using SAS cells. There was no significant adverse 
      effect of BO-1090 treatment with this dosage based on whole blood count, 
      biochemical enzyme profiles in plasma and histopathology of various organs in 
      mouse. Taken together, our current results demonstrate that B0-1090 may have 
      potential as a treatment for oral cavity cancer.

TI  - A pilot study of a metronomic chemotherapy regimen with weekly low-dose docetaxel 
      for previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 15-20
LID - 10.2147/LCTT.S30937 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy is a novel approach that 
      involves frequent administration of a low dose of chemotherapeutic agent without 
      a long interval. PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical pilot study was to evaluate 
      the toxicity and efficacy of LDM chemotherapy with weekly low-dose docetaxel for 
      previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 
      enrolled patients received 15 mg/m(2) of docetaxel intravenously on a weekly 
      basis without any interval. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled in the 
      study; 20 were men, and seven were women. The median age was 62 years (range: 
      32-75). Eleven patients were stage IIIB, and 16 were stage IV. The Eastern 
      Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 or 1. There was no severe 
      hematological adverse effect; importantly, there was no neutropenia or 
      thrombocytopenia. The objective response rate was 7.4% and the disease control 
      rate was 51.9%. The median survival time was 16.4 months (95% CI: 5.7-36.4). 
      CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that our metronomic regimen was well 
      tolerated and active in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Thus, further 
      investigation of this LDM regimen is warranted.

TI  - Clinical activity of lenalidomide in visceral human immunodeficiency 
      virus-related Kaposi sarcoma.
PG  - 1319-22
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2013.5751 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Curative treatment of aggressive Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with 
      conventional chemotherapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients 
      remains difficult. The administration of thalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug 
      with antiangiogenic effects, is limited by its toxicity. This engenders interest 
      in evaluating thalidomide analogues such as lenalidomide with better toxicity 
      profiles. To our knowledge, we describe for the first time a patient with 
      visceral KS successfully treated with lenalidomide. OBSERVATIONS: A man with 
      advanced visceral HIV-related KS progressing after 11 months of highly active 
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and 2 lines of conventional chemotherapy 
      (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and docetaxel) was treated with lenalidomide on 
      a compassionate use basis. He showed a rapid partial response without any 
      substantial adverse effect but experienced relapse after 5 months of treatment, 
      in a context of virologic failure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Similar to our 
      observation, good partial response without toxic effects has been reported in 3 
      patients with only skin involvement. Because immune reconstitution syndrome may 
      occur in HIV-infected patients with KS undergoing HAART, KS improvement may be 
      partly explained by immune recovery. An ongoing US phase 1/2 trial will better 
      evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of lenalidomide in patients with HIV-related 
      KS with and without visceral involvement.

TI  - Alternating doublets: establishing the optimal multifractionated dosing schedule 
      to administer docetaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine in combination.
PG  - 830-6
AB  - The purpose was to determine the optimal multifractionated (MF) dosing schedule 
      to permit the delivery of four active agents in nonsmall cell lung cancer 
      simultaneously in alternating doublets (docetaxel-cisplatin alternating with 
      gemcitabine-vinorelbine). Three MF schedules were used: schedule A weekly; 
      schedule B twice weekly for 2 weeks repeated every 21 days; and schedule C twice 
      weekly every other week. Dose fractions were fixed for each component drug: 
      docetaxel 50 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 20 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 500 mg/m2 plus 
      vinorelbine 25 mg/m2. GCSF 480 micrograms was administered as a single dose 
      concomitant with chemotherapy if the WBC was between 1500 and 3500 cells/mm3. 
      Hematological toxicity, particularly leukopenia and anemia, was the predominant 
      adverse effect observed and was demonstrated on all three schedules. Schedule B 
      was not feasible in that none of the seven cycles were completed and six of seven 
      required hospitalization for febrile neutropenia. The delivery of a four-drug 
      combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of docetaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, 
      and vinorelbine is feasible with an alternating doublet multifractionated dosing 
      scheme with either a weekly or twice weekly every other week schedule.

TI  - A different type of acute myocarditis: a case report of acute autoimmune 
      myocarditis mediated by anti-PD-1 T lymphocyte receptor (pembrolizumab).
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab is an immune check-point inhibitor (ICI), which acts by 
      blocking the T lymphocyte PD-1 inhibitor receptor. It has been increasingly used 
      in advanced or non-responsive tumours with promising results. However, acute 
      myocarditis is an infrequent but potentially life-threatening autoimmune adverse 
      effect related to ICIs. CASE SUMMARY: This case deals with a 69-year-old 
      gentleman on second-line therapy with pembrolizumab for advanced non-small cell 
      lung cancer. Three weeks after first dose, the patient was diagnosed with an 
      autoimmune hepatitis, treated with decreasing corticoid dosage, followed by acute 
      heart failure. On admission, his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed diffuse 
      repolarization changes and a transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left 
      ventricle impairment (left ventricular ejection fraction 32%). High-sensitivity 
      cardiac troponin was elevated and a coronary angiogram was performed showing 
      non-significant obstructive disease. An autoimmune myocarditis was suspected, and 
      high-dose intravenous corticoid, intravenous vasodilators, and loop diuretics 
      were started with favourable response. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, 
      performed 2 weeks after clinical onset, revealed extracellular oedema in the 
      anteroseptal-apical left ventricle segments. A new transthoracic 
      echocardiography, performed after 3 months, showed preserved left ventricle 
      ejection fraction. Finally, the patient was readmitted due to an autoimmune 
      myasthenia-like syndrome. DISCUSSION: Acute autoimmune myocarditis related to 
      ICIs is a challenging diagnosis and its incidence has been underestimated in 
      early studies. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the gold standard test for its 
      diagnosis. Nevertheless, a definite myocarditis diagnosis is possible without EMB 
      when characteristic clinical syndrome, elevated myonecrosis markers, and 
      electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and CMR changes are present together.

TI  - A case of metastatic breast cancer with HER2 gene amplification that responded 
      completely to single agent trastuzumab.
PG  - 374-7
AB  - An 80-year-old woman visited our hospital with a massive ulcerated tumor in the 
      upper lateral quadrant of the right breast. Her performance status was 2. 
      Histopathologically, a mass consisting of a huge primary tumor and metastatic 
      axillary lymph nodes was seen and invasive ductal carcinoma was diagnosed. Both 
      estrogen and progesterone receptors were negative. Herceptest (DakoCytomation, 
      Glostrup, Denmark) showed 2 + staining and HER2 amplification was detected by 
      fluorescent in situ hybridization. CT revealed multiple lung metastases. Her old 
      age and performance status of 2 made aggressive chemotherapy difficult. After 
      receiving 5'-DFUR 600 mg/day as the first line treatment for two months, the 
      tumors progressed. As second-line treatment, single agent therapy with a loading 
      dose, a trastuzumab 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg weekly was recommended. The 
      patient also received 60 Gy radiotherapy. Six months after the second line 
      treatment, the breast tumor disappeared and only a scar remained on the chest 
      wall and axilla. CT showed no lung tumors. During the trastuzumab treatment, no 
      adverse effect was observed. Her performance status improved to zero, and she is 
      alive and free from the disease 24 months after the disappearance of the tumor.

TI  - BRAF L485-P490 deletion mutant metastatic melanoma sensitive to BRAF and MEK 
      inhibition: A case report and literature review.

AB  - Background: The combination therapy of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFis) and MEK 
      inhibitors (MEKis) has been approved as a first-line treatment for metastatic 
      melanoma with BRAF V600 mutants. Recently, BRAF mutations have been divided into 
      three subtypes based on biochemical and signaling characteristics. Unlike V600 
      mutants that show class I BRAF mutations, evidence of the effects of using BRAF 
      inhibitors and MEK inhibitors in patients with non-V600 BRAF mutations remains 
      unclear. The exploration of effective therapy for non-V600 BRAF mutations in 
      melanoma has thus attracted much interest. Case presentation: We reported a case 
      of a 64-year-old female metastatic melanoma patient with a novel BRAF p.L485-P490 
      deletion mutation. The patient received anti-PD1 agent pembrolizumab (100 mg) 
      therapy as the first-line treatment for two cycles, which was terminated due to 
      an intolerable adverse effect. Considering the p.L485-P490 deletion mutation 
      signal as an active dimer which is akin to a class II BRAF mutation, the patient 
      underwent dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy as a second-line 
      treatment. After two cycles of combination treatment, the patient achieved a 
      partial response confirmed by radiological examinations. At the last follow-up 
      date, the patient had obtained over 18 months of progression-free survival, and 
      the treatment was well tolerated. Conclusion: The combination therapy of 
      dabrafenib and trametinib has been proven to be an effective method as a 
      later-line therapy for metastatic melanoma patients with class II BRAF in-frame 
      deletion mutations.

TI  - Docetaxel: new preparation. No first-line use in metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 178-9
AB  - (1) For the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reference first-line 
      cytotoxic chemotherapy is an anthracycline-based combination such as doxorubicin 
      + cyclophosphamide. (2) The clinical file on docetaxel in this indication mainly 
      comprises data from a comparative trial of doxorubicin + docetaxel versus 
      doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide in 429 patients. (3) In this trial the doxorubicin 
      + docetaxel combination failed to increase the duration or quality of survival 
      relative to the doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide combination, whereas its adverse 
      effect profile was somewhat poorer (notably with a risk of severe neutropenia). 
      (4) Docetaxel currently has no place in this setting.
